"""The contracts. Stdlib only: no torch, no comfy, no H3, no numpy.

Everything in this subsystem keys on the ids minted here, so this file has
one job and has to be boring about it: given the same inputs, produce the
same id, on any machine, in any process, forever.

Two rules make that survivable as the schema grows.

1. An id is computed over an explicit IDENTITY PAYLOAD, never over the whole
   record. Adding a field to a manifest (a note, a diagnostic, a timestamp)
   must not move ids that already exist on disk, or every bank in the space
   goes stale for no scientific reason. If a new field genuinely belongs to
   the identity of a capture, it goes in identity() AND PROTOCOL_VERSION
   gets bumped in the same commit, deliberately, with a line in DECISIONS.md.

2. Floats are rounded to 12 significant digits before hashing. A sigma that
   arrives as float32 and a sigma that arrives as float64 name the same
   experimental condition, and an id that disagrees about that is an id that
   lies. 12 digits is far below the noise floor of anything we condition on
   and far above the precision anyone reports.

The model-neutral part of the project lives here. Segment names, block
counts, sampler details and layout rules belong to a backend: this file
treats them as opaque strings and numbers on purpose, so that the second
backend does not require a rewrite of the first one's evidence.
