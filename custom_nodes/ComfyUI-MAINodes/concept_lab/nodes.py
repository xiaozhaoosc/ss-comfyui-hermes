"""The ComfyUI surface of concept_lab: three thin nodes, no rules.

There is exactly one reason these exist this early (DEC-CL-0013 said nodes
wait for T12, DEC-CL-0018 amends its TIMING): a capture has to happen inside
the ComfyUI process, so the seam needs a node before anything can be
measured. They hold no policy. The Arm node builds a TapSpec, reads a stack
fingerprint off the live ModelPatcher, opens a TapSession and installs it on
a CLONE of the model; the Flush node calls finalize(). Every rule is in
concept_lab/, and every refusal comes from there too.

    [MODEL] -> MAI Concept Capture Arm -> [MODEL] -> KSampler -> ... -> decode
                        |                                                 |
                        +--> CONCEPT_CAPTURE -> MAI Concept Capture Flush <+
                                                        (after)

The `after` input is what orders the flush behind the decode. ComfyUI runs
the graph by data dependency, and a flush that is not downstream of anything
can execute before the sampler has taken a single step.

The third node is the mirror of the first (DEC-CL-0020): where the tap READS
block states, `MAI Concept Inject Delta` ADDS a stored one back, so the same
seam serves the capture and the premise test that spends it. It holds no
rules either; the pack, the geometry guard and the controls live in
`concept_lab/backends/h3_inject.py`.

ALPHA. The pass-through gate (E0: tap-installed-disabled renders must be
pixel-identical to the same seed unpatched) has NOT been run live yet. If
these nodes fail it, they get pulled rather than patched around.
