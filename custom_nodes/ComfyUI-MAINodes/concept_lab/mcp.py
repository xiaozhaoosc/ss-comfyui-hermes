"""The agent surface: the same verbs as the CLI, typed.

    <mcp-venv>/bin/python -m concept_lab.mcp

Built on the same MCPServer/pydantic shape the h3-audio-lab server uses, so
one venv serves both and the two read alike. The mcp and pydantic imports
are inside this module rather than the package, so a ComfyUI install with
neither still loads concept_lab fine; only running the server needs them.

What is deliberately NOT on this surface:

  space_export with include_private. Export is a publishing act, packs can
  encode a likeness, and a model cannot prove who is asking. The agent can
  export the shareable set and can see exactly which packs were held back
  and why; releasing a private one is a human's keystroke through the CLI.

  Any verb that would run a model. Capture costs GPU time on a shared box
  with production instances on it, so the agent plans and a human launches.
  capture_plan gives the agent the whole cost picture for free.

An agent that can measure everything and publish nothing is the right shape
for this subsystem.
