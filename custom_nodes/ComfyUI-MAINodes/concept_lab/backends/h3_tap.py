"""The H3 block tap: pass-through instrumentation for ONE armed capture.

This is the only file in `concept_lab` that touches torch and ComfyUI, and
it exists because a capture cannot be made from outside the process: the
states we want live for microseconds inside a DiT block loop, and the
launch that computed them is part of the condition (DEC-CL-0015).

The seam is the sanctioned one, read off the installed ComfyUI on
2026-08-15 rather than remembered:

  comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:522-526  the model's `forward` runs `_forward`
        through a DIFFUSION_MODEL WrapperExecutor, passing x, timestep,
        context and transformer_options POSITIONALLY and `minimax_payload=`
        as a keyword. That is the only place the packed layout is reachable
        from outside, so the wrapper's whole job is to stash it.
  comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:643-655  the block loop calls
        `patches_replace["dit"][("double_block", i)](args, {"original_block":
        block_wrap})` and takes `["img"]` off the result. `args["img"]` is
        2-D `[seq_len, hidden]`: batch is always 1 here (:538-539).
  comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:404-420  PackedLayout exposes `.seq_len`,
        `.segments` as `(start, stop, kind)` triples, `.position_ids`, and
        `.signature = (text_len, latent_t, latent_h, latent_w, audio_t)`.
  comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:70-81  `_frame_grid` builds one latent frame's
        rows from `dim // patch` per axis with patch=2, so one latent frame
        is `(latent_h//2) * (latent_w//2)` rows, and video rows are
        frame-major (`patchify_video`'s einsum puts t outermost, :42-49).
  comfy/model_patcher.py:430 clone, :667 set_model_patch_replace,
        :1343 add_wrapper_with_key. Installing on a clone is what keeps the
        caller's MODEL unpatched.
  comfy/samplers.py:510-513  transformer_options carries `cond_or_uncond`
        (a list; 0 is the cond entry), `sigmas` (this call's sigma) and
        `sample_sigmas` (the whole schedule).

TWO RULES THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND.

Pass-through is not a goal, it is the gate. The block patch calls the
original block, records from a detached view of its output, and returns the
ORIGINAL dict object. Nothing is written into `args` or into the returned
dict, so with `enabled=False` the tap is a function call and a branch.

Nothing is recorded that cannot be re-identified. The capture id is
computable before the first tensor is written (identity is stack + variant
+ tap + seed + sampler + replicate + launch, and tensors are not identity),
tensors are written as they are captured rather than accumulated in VRAM,
and every file lands with its sha256 in a TensorRef.

The variant half of that identity is MEASURED here rather than declared by
the caller (DEC-CL-0019): the first wrapper call hashes the text-encoder
output and every ref and keyframe latent the model was handed, and those
hashes are the variant's sources. The refusal that protects the bank is
armed at the same moment, before the first byte, and tensors stream into
`<id>.partial` until the manifest is filed.
