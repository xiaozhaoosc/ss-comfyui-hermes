"""The H3 delta injection: ADD a stored delta at the seam the tap reads.

The mirror of `h3_tap`. The tap reads block states out of a running forward
and files them; this reads a delta back in and adds it to the target-video
rows of the same block output, at chosen blocks and steps. It is the
instrument for the premise test ("take the delta overlap reference and
generate something with it"), not a compiler and not a factor library:
nothing here decides what a delta MEANS.

Same seam, read off the installed ComfyUI on 2026-08-15 and unchanged from
the tap's reading (h3_tap's module docstring has the line numbers):
comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:643-655 runs each tapped block through
`patches_replace["dit"][("double_block", i)]`, and `args["img"]` is 2-D
`[seq_len, hidden]`. The wrapper at model.py:522-526 is still the only place
the packed layout is reachable, so the wrapper's whole job is to stash it and
to refuse a run whose video geometry does not match the pack's.

THREE RULES THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND.

The write is in place and the dict is the block's own. `out["img"]` is
modified through a view of its video rows and the ORIGINAL dict object comes
back, so an injection is arithmetic on the state rather than a rebuilt
pipeline: with `enabled=False`, or with `control="zero"`, the code path runs
and the numbers do not move.

A delta is only addable where its rows mean the same thing. A pack carries
`latent_t` and `frame_rows` (the manifests do not carry the packed
signature tuple, only segments and a position hash), and the first wrapper
call recomputes both off the live layout exactly as `TapSession._write`'s
frame_mean branch does. A mismatch refuses BEFORE any block fires, printing
both pairs. text_len and audio_t are free to differ: a different prompt is
allowed, because the delta lives on video rows.

Controls are part of the instrument, not of the analysis. `zero`,
`time_shuffle`, `space_shuffle` and `sign_flip` are applied to the delta
ONCE per tensor, so every arm of a read runs identical code with different
numbers: the reductions get theirs at load, and a `full` state gets the same
treatment on the lazy load that first needs it.

A `full` state is not a reduction and is not held like one. `mode='full'`
adds the whole stored `[latent_t * frame_rows, hidden]` block state, which
is ~160 MB per (block, step) at production geometry, so those tensors are
read from the pack ONE key at a time on first use and cached only in the
model's own device and dtype, only for the (block, step) pairs the session
actually selected. The reductions stay eager: they are kilobytes.
