"""The verbs. One implementation of every operation in this subsystem.

Three surfaces call this module and nothing else: cli.py for a shell, mcp.py
for an agent, nodes.py for a graph. None of them holds a rule the others
cannot see, which is what makes them interchangeable. If you find yourself
writing logic in a surface, it belongs here.

Every verb takes plain arguments and returns a plain JSON-able dict. No
tensors cross this boundary, no ComfyUI types, no torch. That is not
fastidiousness: it is what lets an agent drive the whole subsystem over a
pipe, and what lets the tests run in a process with no GPU in it.

Verbs that are not implemented yet RAISE. They do not return an empty
result that looks like a measurement. A research tool that quietly returns
nothing is worse than one that refuses, because the nothing gets recorded.
