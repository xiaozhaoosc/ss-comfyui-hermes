"""Model profiles: the per-model clock facts the de-rope pipeline needs, so one
hold map (integer hold per world frame) can be retimed for any model.

A profile is five numbers and a flag:

  block        frames per latent time block. Holds of 2+ are quantised to a
               multiple of this, because a held frame only owns its own block
               when its hold fills whole blocks (LTX-2.5: 8; measured, d=8
               barely moves and d=16 does).
  hold_scale   how many world frames one oracle hold unit buys on this model.
               The oracle emits holds of 1-4 in H3 terms (scale 1). LTX-2.5
               needed x4 (hold 4 -> 16x) to move at all: MEASURED, not derived.
  legal        (step, offset): legal pixel lengths are step*k + offset
               (H3 17k+5, LTX-2.5 8k+1, Wan 4k+1).
  fps          the model's native frame rate (what a second of holds costs).
  cap_seconds  longest single pass, or None. LTX-2.5: 20 s, from its absolute-
               seconds positional cap. H3's wall is VRAM and moves with the card.
  measured     True only when hold_scale and block come from a ladder on this
               model. A custom or unmeasured profile is stamped as such in every
               report: a confident default here is how LTX d=8 fooled us for a day.

  latent       how that model's VIDEO LATENT maps onto pixel frames, so the jerk
               oracle can read the model's own latent: channels, and the token
               clock as (first, block): token 0 owns `first` frames, every later
               token owns `block` frames (LTX-2.5: 1 + 8k; Wan: 1 + 4k). H3 is
               the exception with its (1,4,4,4,4)-per-17 grid and five-phase
               normalisation, kept in motion.py bit-identical; `latent: None`
               here means "use the H3 code path".

Holds of 1 are never scaled: a hold of 1 is plain video on any model.

Presets live in PRESETS. Users extend them without touching code by dropping a
JSON object {id: profile} at <ComfyUI user dir>/mainodes_models.json (or the
path in $MAINODES_MODELS_JSON); a row there overrides a preset of the same id.
Pure python, no torch, no comfy: unit-testable.
