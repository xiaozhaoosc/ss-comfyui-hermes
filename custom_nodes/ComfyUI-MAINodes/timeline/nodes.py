"""The ComfyUI node surface of the timeline surface, plus the recorder pair.

Two doors onto one compiler. H3TimelineAnalyze/H3TimelineRender drive the
whole plan-to-graph path in one step; H3DrawnPlan/H3PlanSettings/
H3PlanEstimate hand a plan's compiled answers out as typed outputs, so a
graph author can wire the same numbers into stock H3 nodes and get the same
execution. Whichever door you use, the answers come from timeline/h3.

Two-phase execution, no mid-graph pause (spec): ANALYZE is cheap and writes
plan.json; COMPILE+RENDER is phase 2. The auto checkbox is phase 2's entry:
auto = accept the proposal verbatim and compile immediately (the zero-click
mode), off = the plan is written and you open an editor.

These nodes are THIN CLIENTS. Every rule lives in timeline/ (semantics) and
timeline/h3/ (the model's reality); this file only moves strings around and
draws a preview.
