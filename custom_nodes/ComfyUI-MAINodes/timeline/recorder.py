"""The flight recorder: one local JSON line per render, nothing phones home.

Why it exists: layer (b) of the price meter must never predict minutes from
GPU specs. It predicts from the user's OWN history — s/step against work
units, keyed per device AND per model/quant so new hardware or a new quant
starts a fresh curve.

Peaks come from IN-PROCESS torch counters, deliberately not nvidia-smi:
per-process readout lies on some cards (the Max-Q lesson, GPU1 here).

Least-invasive hook: a pair of nodes the user drops at the front and back of
a graph. H3RecordStart resets the counters and passes its input through;
H3RecordStop reads them, times the gap, and appends the line. No monkey
patching of ComfyUI's executor, nothing that survives a failed run and
poisons the next one.

The 'streamed' flag is read from ComfyUI's own partial-load log lines when a
log path is reachable, else null — never guessed. The window read is bounded
by the BYTE OFFSET captured at start(), so a partial-load line emitted by the
PREVIOUS run can never be attributed to this one.

TODO(T2) — THE CRASH JOURNAL. This pair records successes. A run that OOMs,
is interrupted, or dies mid-VAE never reaches stop(), so it silently leaves
no record — and those are exactly the runs that locate the VRAM cliff, so
their absence CENSORS the calibration set toward optimism (only survivors
are sampled). The fix is not a bigger record, it is a different hook:
executor-level STAGE EVENTS (queued / model loaded / sampling / decoding /
finished|failed) journalled as they happen, so an aborted run leaves a
partial line with its stage and its last known peak. Wants a ComfyUI
execution callback rather than a node pair; deliberately not attempted
tonight, because a hook that survives a crash is exactly the kind of thing
that must not break the pack when it does not.
