"""H3RecipeProfile — the EXPERIMENT-DERIVED half of what we know.

The epistemic boundary (amendment 2, item 1): structural facts live in
spec.py and are relied on. Everything here came out of a run, so the
compiler PREFERS these values and a proposer may CHALLENGE one — where a
challenge means the plan is flagged for eyes, never a silent override.

Every value carries lightweight machine-readable provenance (amendment 2,
item 2): a RecipeValue with value, confidence and evidence as plain string
refs into our packet/report namespace. No provenance database, no new
infrastructure; strings now, richer later. DEPRECATION IS FIRST CLASS: a
superseded value keeps its record and the reason it existed, so the system
remembers why a workaround was there after the workaround is gone.

Profiles version; code does not. Add a new profile, do not edit history.

Stdlib only.
