"""H3ModelSpec — STRUCTURAL facts about the MiniMax-H3 model/VAE family.

The epistemic boundary (amendment 2, item 1): everything in this file is a
property of the artifact. The compiler RELIES on these; nothing may
override them, no proposer may challenge them, and a "measurement" that
contradicts one of them is a bug in the measurement. Values that came out
of an EXPERIMENT and could be overturned by a better experiment live in
recipe.py instead, where they are challengeable.

Every field cites where the fact comes from: [SRC] = read out of the
implementation, [AUTH] = upstream statement.

Stdlib only.
