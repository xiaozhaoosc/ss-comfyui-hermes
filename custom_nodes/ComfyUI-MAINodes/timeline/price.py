"""The three-layer price meter, as a COMPOSITION of three separable factors.

    cost = plan GEOMETRY  x  backend COMPLEXITY MODEL  x  machine CALIBRATION

No layer hardcodes another's numbers (amendment 2, item 5):
  - Geometry comes from the backend's compile pass: how much work the plan
    asks for versus a plain render of the same clip. Units are opaque here
    ("work units"); for H3 they are latent tokens.
  - ComplexityModel is the backend's RecipeProfile speaking: how cost grows
    with work units (an exponent + measured anchors). Hardware-independent
    by construction, which is why layer (a) needs zero calibration.
  - Calibration is the user's own machine, from the flight recorder. Absent
    -> layers (a) and (c-stub) still answer; layer (b) says "not calibrated"
    rather than predicting from GPU specs.

Layers, in spec language:
  (a) EQUIVALENT CLIP TIME — always available. "= 3.4x a plain render."
  (b) REAL MINUTES — only after self-calibration from the recorder.
  (c) VRAM FIT LINE — a cliff, not a multiplier. STUBBED, see VramModel.

Stdlib only.
