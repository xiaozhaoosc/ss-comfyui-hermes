"""Repair: regenerate a few bad frames of a finished clip and splice them
back, frame-exact (alpha, 2026-08-23).

The bilateral sibling of the extension nodes. Extension asks "what comes
after this clip"; repair asks "these frames are wrong, render them again
and give me back the same clip with only those frames different".

Two nodes, no model patch, no new de-rope:

  H3 Repair Plan     the arithmetic, in integers: snap the operator's bad
                     frame range outward to whole latent time tokens, carry
                     the span through a nearby shot cut if there is one,
                     and emit the three things the graph needs from it (a
                     hold map for H3 Time Smear, a time-varying regenerate
                     mask for H3 V2V Init, and the splice bounds)
  H3 Repair Splice   original frames outside the splice, repaired frames
                     inside, and the seam numbers that say whether it worked

DOCTRINE (minted 2026-08-23 from three measured cells, EXTENSION_V0):
regeneration MASKS snap to latent tokens; SPLICES are free. The mask has
to obey the grid because a latent time token cannot be half regenerated
(H3 V2V Init max-pools any mask onto the token clock), but the assembly
afterwards is pure frame selection and may cut anywhere. So: extend the
mask where the grid forces it, then choose the splice points for picture
reasons - enter in quiet motion, exit ON a shot cut whenever one is near,
and leave every untouched frame as original pixels.

Why the cut rule earns its keep. On the validation cell the token snap
pushed the regenerated span across a hard cut, so the model reinvented the
first frames of the next shot: the exit seam popped at 2.6x the clip's
median frame delta. Extending the mask through the cut did not fix it
(2.3x). Handing back to the original AT its own cut did: entry 0.21x,
exit 130.5 against the original's own 130.9 at that cut, i.e. the seam IS
the cut and reads as the edit the shot always had.
The in-graph rerun of the same cell reproduced it: entry 0.26x, exit within
1.8% of the source's own cut delta, outside-splice diff exactly 0.

Token geometry (motion.py _token_frame_spans): frames group in 17s, each
group is 5 tokens covering (1, 4, 4, 4, 4) frames, so every 5th token is a
singleton on a 17-multiple; legal clip lengths are 17k+5. A bad frame at 45
lives in the token covering 43..46 and a bad frame at 47 in the token
covering 47..50, which is why "frames 45-47" becomes "regenerate 43..50".
