# ComfyUI-MAINodes

Custom nodes for MiniMax-H3. Two groups: **Motion Lab** (a test-time fix
for fast-motion smearing) and **Contact-Sheet diffusion** (five views of
one subject from one reference image).

Like it? A star helps. Want to feed the GPU? [Sponsor the experiments](#support-mainodes).

## Start here

- **Which graph:** [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md). Four
  starting points, the essential node chain as a diagram, and what each
  specialised graph adds to it.
- **Which settings for your card:** [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md). VRAM and
  system RAM rows, measured.
- **Which dial for which symptom:** [`TUNING.md`](TUNING.md).
- **What is still alpha:** [`ALPHA.md`](ALPHA.md).

The short version: start from
[`examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json),
keep pass 1 at 12 steps on the base model, let the turbo LoRA do pass 2,
and reach for `inject` (0.50 sharper, 0.70 safer) before any other dial.

## What's new

Cloned before 2026-08-19 and `git pull` errors? Run
`git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main`, or re-clone.

**Repair, a per-block clock, and the chaining nodes** (2026-08-24, alpha).
Five additions, all opt-in and all alpha. `H3 Repair Plan` / `H3 Repair
Splice` re-render a few bad frames of a finished clip and hand back the same
clip with only those frames different ([below](#repairing-a-few-bad-frames)).
`H3 DyRoPE` gives the true-duration RoPE clock to SOME blocks or SOME steps
instead of all of them, which is what separates the timing correction from
the flash and jitter it used to cost
([below](#dyrope-who-gets-the-true-clock)). `H3 V2V Init` grew
`audio_prefix_ticks`, the audio twin of the video prefix freeze, so a
continuation can carry the previous segment's sound across the join
([below](#anchoring-audio-across-a-join-alpha)). `H3 Drift Control` and
`H3 Delta Color Carry` attack the two things that decay down a chain of
segments, clean-conditioning error and VAE round-trip colour
([below](#chained-segments-drift-and-colour-alpha)). And window mode, the
excerpt-shaped graph where only part of a long clip is retimed, finally has
a page: [docs/WINDOW_MODE.md](docs/WINDOW_MODE.md).

**Long de-ropes on small cards** (2026-08-18, alpha). A de-rope pass at
d_max 4 on an 8 to 12 second clip is ~200k packed tokens, and the stock H3
block materialises its fused QKV and SwiGLU tensors for the whole sequence
(8.6 and 15.4 GiB at that length), which is what OOMs 24 GB cards and, at
1376x768, a 96 GB one. `H3 Streamed Blocks` runs every DiT block in token
chunks with the same math (int8 and W4A8 activations quantise per row and
accumulate in int32, so the result is bit-equal to stock; measured on
same-seed renders, video and audio) and streams the output head the same
way. With ComfyUI's dynamic VRAM and `--fast-disk`, the same 702-frame pass
that OOMed a 96 GB card renders on a 16 GB card in a 32 GB machine at the
same seconds per step (316 vs 311), because the step is attention-bound at
that length and the weight traffic hides under it. Alongside it: `H3 Memory
Probe` (per-block, per-phase VRAM and RSS ledger with a hoverable timeline,
plus an optional allocator trace), `H3 Free Cache` (return the allocator
pool before VAE decode; 17 GiB back on the long pass), `H3 Evict Text
Encoder`. All opt-in, nothing changes unless the node is in the graph. The
memory numbers behind them are in the docstrings of `vram_lab.py`; the
small-card recipe, what to expect and the environment it was measured in are
in [LOWVRAM.md](LOWVRAM.md), with the example graph
`examples/motion_pipeline_lowvram.json`; the alpha status is in
[ALPHA.md](ALPHA.md#vram-lab). Evening additions: two opt-in K/V store
options in the same node (`kvi8r`, rotated int8 K/V, forward peak +9.5 GiB
instead of +11.9; `kvi8s`, the same bytes in SageAttention's layout attended
on int8/fp8 tensor cores with no dequant), both approximation tier with the
measurements and what is still owed in LOWVRAM.md, kvi8r on in the low-VRAM
example graph; the example graph moves to
the int8_convrot video VAE (2.2 GiB less, decode 1.5x faster, 60 dB PSNR
against fp16 on the same latent); and a fix for the `H3 Audio Smear` /
`H3 Audio Recover` istft crash on short stretched tails (user report).

**Dialogue survives a de-rope now** (2026-08-17). A de-rope used to break
speech, and the way it broke was confusing: the body came back at the right
speed and the mouth did not, so held regions sounded rushed while the tail
sounded fine. The cause is that the picture gets an init and obeys it while
the audio starts from zeros, so pass 2 writes a fresh performance at natural
rate and moves the mouth to that. Recovery then compresses something that was
never slow. New node `H3 Audio Smear` stretches the baseline track onto the
same dilated clock so pass 2 renders a genuinely slowed take instead. See
[Dialogue through a de-rope](#dialogue-through-a-de-rope) for the three nodes
to add to a graph you already have.

**The graph to start from** is
[`motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json):
full-reference mode with the audio init wired, 12 steps on the base model for
pass 1 and the turbo LoRA at 6 steps for the de-rope. On 192 frames at 1 MP
that is **12 minutes end to end**, against 36 for the same graph at 25 steps
both passes without turbo. The audio init itself is free in both currencies,
costing no measurable time and no measurable sharpness.

## What is stable, and what is not

**Stable:** the Motion Lab de-rope pipeline and Contact-Sheet diffusion, both
described below. Their dials have measured numbers behind them in
[TUNING.md](TUNING.md), and their example graphs run out of the box.

**Not stable:** Concept Lab, the timeline surface, the motion adapter pilot,
the manual mask paths, and the audio init above, which works but has only
been heard on a narrow slice of material. [ALPHA.md](ALPHA.md) says which is
which and where each has and has not been tested. Alpha nodes carry
`(alpha)` in the ComfyUI menu and load behind a guarded loader, so a broken
one cannot take the pack down.

## Motion Lab

H3 smears bursty motion: backflips, fast sword arcs, whip-fast reversals.
The cause is structural. One latent token spans four pixel frames, and at
high motion speed those four frames need four distinct poses that a single
token can't hold. Re-denoising the affected region doesn't help, because
the missing poses were never generated in the first place.

This pipeline works around that at inference time. It re-generates the
clip as a slowed-down version of itself, seeded from the original. Frames
where motion is too fast get held (repeated) so the model has more
temporal room, the result is generated video-to-video from that retimed
init at partial denoise, and the original frame rate is recovered
afterward by dropping the held frames. The oracle that decides where to
slow down reads the clip's own latent. No extra model, no training.

Three ready-made graphs live in [`examples/`](examples/):
[`motion_pipeline.json`](examples/motion_pipeline.json) drags straight
onto the ComfyUI canvas;
[`motion_pipeline_api.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_api.json) is the
same graph in API format for scripted use; and
Three flows cover almost every job, and the examples keep one graph per job:
the full-quality pipeline (25-step pass 1, 25-step pass 2, no turbo), the fast
flow (12-step turbo pass 1, 6-step turbo pass 2, inject 0.48 or 0.7), and the
low-VRAM stack in [LOWVRAM.md](LOWVRAM.md). Inject 0.48 replaced 0.50 as the
shipped default: at 0.50 and above some scenes measurably loosen their hold on
the reference. Historical dial studies and superseded variants live in
[`examples/archive/`](examples/archive/), still runnable as committed. When the
defaults are too slow for your card or your patience, [FASTER.md](FASTER.md)
prices every speed dial from measured runs.

[`motion_pipeline_turbo.json`](examples/archive/motion_pipeline_turbo.json) is the
same pipeline with the regeneration pass running on the LightX2V 4-step
turbo LoRA (Kijai's ComfyUI conversion, strength 0.8, er_sde with a beta
schedule, 3 of 4 steps after injection). Point the LoRA loader at
wherever you saved the conversion; community strength range is 0.65 to
0.8, and v0.1 of that LoRA is a preview, so judge results accordingly.

How we actually use this after trying every combination: **turbo is for
getting your prompt right, the pipeline is for the keeper, and mixing
them is a waste of time.** Iterate prompts and seeds on plain turbo
generations to learn what you will get globally, then run the winner
through the base pipeline. Putting the turbo LoRA inside the
regeneration pass saves a few minutes on a clip you have already decided
deserves the full treatment, and it costs quality on exactly that clip;
we do not recommend it. The turbo-inside graphs remain for people with
different budgets. One wrinkle that did earn its keep: starting the
turbo PREVIEW on the base model for the first couple of steps before
handing off to turbo (H3 Expert Schedule with inject 1.0) may buy
preview fidelity cheaply; we are still testing it. A unified workflow
with a preview/final toggle (H3 Mode Switch, lazy: only the chosen path
executes) is the intended end state.

A fourth graph,
[`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_probe_expert.json`](examples/archive/motion_pipeline_probe_expert.json),
is the fast path: instead of finishing the baseline it runs only the
first 6 steps (H3 Probe Schedule, configurable) and reads the oracle and
the init from the early x0 estimate, then regenerates with a base-model
head and a turbo tail (H3 Expert Schedule). Cheapest of the set; no
full-speed audio track to blend, and the saved preview is intentionally
rough.

There is also [`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_i50.json`](examples/archive/motion_pipeline_i50.json),
the same finals graph with the inject 0.50 preset selected, for people who
prefer the sharper flavor without touching a dropdown.

For 24 to 32 GB cards there is
[`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_featherweight.json`](examples/archive/motion_pipeline_featherweight.json):
the same finals graph pointed at the smallest community-published models
(w4a8 DiT, int8_convrot VAE, nvfp4 text encoder). Needs ComfyUI 0.31+.
Measured numbers and the honest caveats live in
[TUNING.md](TUNING.md#featherweight-stack-measured-comfyui-031).

Everything from here through the editor and segment graphs is new
(2026-08-09) and marked **alpha**: the node interfaces may still move,
and the interactive widget is young. The classic pipeline nodes above
are untouched and differentially regression-tested against the
previous release (same inputs, identical outputs).

And for the "the oracle is overzealous, I know exactly where the
problem is" crowd:
[`motion_pipeline_targeted.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_targeted.json)
(API twin alongside) puts a human in the loop. The oracle still
proposes, but its hold map passes through **H3 Manual Hold Map**, which
keeps holds only inside the time ranges you type (`36-60, 1.5s-2.4s:3`,
frames or seconds, optional per-range hold count; leave the oracle
unwired to author holds directly). Queue once and watch the saved
oraclemap video to see where the heat pools; type your ranges; queue
again. The node's report output prices the pass before you pay for it:
world length in, effective regeneration length out, with an optional
minutes estimate from your measured s/step. Since cost scales with the
held spans, targeting one burst in a long clip is also the biggest
speed lever this pack has. The drag-in graph additionally carries a
muted spatial branch: export a frame, paint a mask, load it, unmute,
and H3 Motion Composite returns your masked region to baseline timing
with a feathered seam (see below).

The full editing experience is
[`motion_pipeline_editor.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_editor.json)
(API twin alongside): the **H3 Motion Editor** node puts a DAW-style
editor right on the canvas. Queue once to load the filmstrip, then
work on the node: drag bracket blocks on the timeline (multiple
blocks, snapped to the model's token grid, jerk profile drawn
underneath so you can see what the oracle sees), click a block and
step frame by frame painting the problem areas with brush and eraser
(onion skin included), set per-block dials for hold, feather size,
feather profile and direction, edge grow, and temporal fade, and
toggle `A` on hold, feather, or strength to draw an automation
envelope with draggable breakpoints, exactly like an automation lane
in a DAW. A block with no strokes regenerates its whole time span;
strokes narrow it to the painted region. Queue again and only the
regeneration side re-runs; the baseline stays cached. The node's
outputs are ordinary `hold_map` and MASK wires, the mask arriving
pre-feathered and envelope-scaled (`mask_is_soft` on the composite),
so everything downstream is the same pipeline. Agents skip the GUI
and write the same `editor_state` JSON directly; the contract is in
the node's docstring.

And the compute payoff of targeting:
[`motion_pipeline_editor_segment.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_editor_segment.json)
(API twin alongside) adds **H3 Segment Crop** and **H3 Segment Splice**
around the editor. The regeneration chain runs only on the editor's
held window plus a few real-time handle frames, then the recovered
segment splices back into the baseline with video and sample-accurate
audio crossfades inside the handles. Cost scales with dilated frame
count, so a one-burst window in a longer clip regenerates severalfold
faster than the whole world; the crop node's report output states the
exact ratio for your selection. On FL2VA checkpoints, wire the crop's
first/last frame outputs into the regeneration conditioning to pin the
seam poses.

Four shorter paths, each measured on one prompt and seed:

[`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_split_lora.json`](examples/archive/motion_pipeline_split_lora.json)
splits pass 1 mid-trajectory. The bare model runs the early, high-sigma
steps -- where the motion is actually decided -- and a turbo LoRA takes
over for the low-sigma steps, off one schedule with no re-noising
between them (`SplitSigmas` + `DisableNoise`). Running a turbo LoRA
across the whole of pass 1 cost about 22% of mean subject motion and 30%
of the peak in our measurements, and the second pass never gave it back;
splitting recovered 99% of it, and still finished faster than a plain
12-step pass 1.

[`motion_pipeline_upscale_derope.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_upscale_derope.json)
does the de-rope and a spatial upscale in the same second pass: pass 1
renders at 0.4 MP, the smeared frames are resampled to the target size,
and the regeneration runs there. The second pass rebuilds detail rather
than interpolating it -- measured 89% of a native 1.5 MP render's
high-frequency detail for 83% of the wall time. Most of what the cheap
pass 1 saves, the larger second pass gives back: pass 1 drops from 179 s
to 31 s, and pass 2 rises from 305 s to 372 s. The cost is jerk
removal: a soft pass 1 gives the oracle blurrier evidence, so it cuts
less of it.

[`motion_pipeline_rolling_window.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_rolling_window.json)
(alpha) is the upscale de-rope split into budgeted windows, for cards
that cannot hold the whole dilated pass at once. **H3 Window Plan**
divides the clip into as many windows as your `max_dilated_frames`
budget requires and emits one per queue item: queue once, read the plan
report (wired to a preview node; it prices every window and names each
cut cold or hot before anything runs), then set the queue batch count
to the window count and queue once more -- the `window` widget
increments itself per batch item, seed-widget style, so the whole set
renders from one click. **H3 Window Collect** banks each rendered window to disk
(`output/h3_windows`, so a crash or reboot costs one window, not the
run) and splices the full set into the baseline once the last one
lands. On our test clip the peak window was 62 latent tokens against
77 for the one-pass version, paid for as 1.47x the one-pass total in
generated frames at the budget that forced the split. `coverage`
defaults to `full clip` so calm spans get the same second-pass repaint
as the action; `held span` is cheaper but leaves everything outside the
held span at baseline resolution, which on this graph means visibly
soft the moment motion calms.

**H3 Conditioning Bank** (alpha) keeps the text encoder out of the
window items. Wire it between the encode node and the guider: the first
item encodes and banks the conditioning to disk, and every later item
reads the tensors back. Its `conditioning` input is lazy, so on a bank
hit ComfyUI never executes the encode node or the CLIP loader behind
it, and the encoder (14.96 GB resident on the int8 ref2va stack, 21.2
GB peak on a 16 GB-simulated card) is never loaded for that item. To be
exact about what it buys: requeueing the same graph with only the
`window` widget changed already hits ComfyUI's own node cache, so
nothing is re-encoded there. What loses that cache is queueing any
other workflow in between, restarting ComfyUI, or editing anything
upstream of the encode, and the bank survives all three. It is not
window-specific: a seed hunt and an extension chain on the same prompt
encode once between them too.

**H3 Latent Bank** (alpha) is the same trick one stage later, and on
this graph it is worth more. The pass-1 baseline render is cached
exactly like the conditioning is, and lost exactly as easily, so an
interleaved workflow makes window item 2 re-render the whole baseline
before it starts its own window. Bank the pass-1 LATENT and every
consumer is served from it: the video decode, the audio decode, and H3
Jerk Oracle, which reads the latent directly. Latents are the cheap
thing to keep: the AV latent of a 107-frame 480x832 clip is 4.8 MB,
against 513 MB for the same clip as float32 frames. The staleness
contract is stated plainly on the node: `bank_key` plus a hash of
`seed` and `fingerprint`, and nothing else is fingerprinted for you.

Measured on a simulated 32 GB card (a large card fenced down with
`--reserve-vram`; int8 stack, 0.4 to 1.5 MP, 107 frames): the one-pass
de-rope peaked at 30.7 GB, touched the ceiling, and streamed the DiT
layer by layer (208 lowvram patches). Split into two windows the peaks
were 22.5 and 24.6 GB and the DiT stayed resident, so the two windows
together (440 s) matched the one-pass wall time (460 s) while
generating 1.4x the frames. The lower peak is what buys the extra work
back: on a card at the offload cliff, not streaming beats not
splitting.

[`motion_pipeline_fast_iterate.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_fast_iterate.json)
is the same idea sized for iteration: 0.2 MP in, 0.4 MP out, about 95
seconds end to end. Use it to find out whether the choreography lands
before paying for a final.

[`motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json)
runs the pipeline in full-reference mode, with the six-section prompt
contract and a reference image (wired to ComfyUI's stock `example.png`
so it runs out of the box -- swap in your own). It also seeds pass 2's
AUDIO rows with the baseline performance, which is what keeps dialogue
intact through a de-rope: without a seed, pass 2 writes fresh speech at
natural rate and drags the mouth to match it, and recovery then
compresses those lips by the hold factor, so held regions come back
rushed while the unheld tail sounds fine. `H3 Audio Smear` stretches the
baseline track onto the dilated clock, `VAEEncodeAudio` encodes it, and
`H3 V2V Init`'s `audio_latent` seeds it at `follow the original
performance (0.5)`.

**This is the balanced setting, and it is the one to start from.** Pass 1
runs 12 steps on the base model, pass 2 runs the turbo LoRA at
`total_steps 6` with inject 0.50, so about three steps actually execute on
the de-rope. On 192 frames at 1 MP on an RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell that is
**12 minutes end to end**. The same graph without turbo, at 25 steps for
both passes, took 36 minutes on the Max-Q card, which runs roughly 13%
slower on sustained 1 MP work, so call it 32 minutes equivalent. Nearly
three times the wall time, and the turbo arm was the one that got the
playback verdict.

**The audio init itself is free.** Pass 2 measured 6:06 with the seed
against about 7:20 without it on the same card, which is inside run to run
variation. It also costs nothing in picture quality: 91.8 against 91.3 on
laplacian variance, inside the noise floor of the video encoder itself.
And because the seed only touches pass 2, re-running a graph after wiring
it serves pass 1 from cache.

It writes two finals so you can hear the difference the seed makes:
`_recovered` keeps the original performance (the safe route, and the one
we ship as the default), and `_seededfoley` takes pass 2's own foley
retimed to the world clock -- legitimate ONLY because the rows were
seeded. Alpha: measured on a handful of clips, all sword-fight material
with two speakers. Speech over music, a single speaker and hold factors
other than 4 are untested.

[`motion_pipeline_ref2va.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va.json)
is the same graph WITHOUT the audio init, kept as the archived version.
Reach for it only if you want the older behaviour; on any clip with
dialogue, prefer the audioinit graph above.

**There is a resolution floor.** Below roughly 0.4 MP the subject smears
regardless of configuration, and every quality judgement we took from a
448x448 render turned out to be worthless. The small-canvas paths are for
iteration, not finals. Separately, a distilled LoRA wants the size it was
trained at: ours was mush at 448x448 and clean at its native 768x768.

**Do not run a turbo LoRA at its distilled step count in pass 2.** A
distilled LoRA's step budget is sized for a full denoise from noise;
pass 2 is a partial re-denoise from a v2v init, so those steps land far
too finely and the subject dissolves into a coarse mosaic. Running an
8-step LoRA for 8 steps of a 0.50 injection failed at both 0.2 and
1.0 MP and with either v1.0 file; 4 steps of the same schedule was
clean. Budget pass-2 steps against the fraction of the schedule you are
actually running, not against the LoRA's name.

All of them generate or probe a baseline, read its oracle, regenerate,
and recover, in one queue item. The oracle's length and the regeneration
length are wired dynamically, so changing the clip duration needs no
other edits. Each node's info button documents its inputs.

### Nodes

| node | knob | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| H3 Jerk Oracle | `q` | 0.75 | jerk quantile treated as "hot"; higher = tighter span, lower cost |
| | `d_max` | 4 | peak hold count; below 4, smearing starts returning in our tests |
| | `ramp` | on | smooth shoulders on the hold curve; hard steps caused visible stutter |
| | `bridge` | 8 | fill dips between peaks of the same burst (see below); 0 = off |
| | `preset` | balanced | balanced / max quality / economy; `custom` uses the knobs |
| H3 Time Smear | `dilation` | 4 | uniform hold count, used when no hold_map is wired |
| H3 Inject Schedule | `inject` | 0.70 | fraction of the denoise schedule that runs. Lower keeps more of the init (including its artifacts); higher lets the model drift from the source choreography. 0.5 to 0.8 is the useful range |
| | `preset` | 0.70 | 0.70 / 0.50 / 0.80; `custom` uses the knob |
| H3 V2V Init | `length` | 0 (auto) | wraps the encoded init as H3's joint AV latent; audio regenerates with the video |
| H3 Exact Recover | | | drops held frames per the hold map; recovery is frame selection, not resampling |
| H3 Audio Recover | `fps` | 24 | retimes the regenerated audio to the original clock with the same hold map, pitch preserved, so the recovered video keeps its own foley |
| | `reference_mix` | 1 | whose track survives: 1 = the pass-1 baseline audio intact (default; regenerated audio quality varies, especially off turbo passes), 0 = the regenerated foley (leaner, one performance). The two performances are different takes, so mid values blend them; the dial is happiest near its ends |
| H3 Jerk Heatmap | `alpha`, `strip_height` | 0.55, 96 | the oracle-watching overlay from the demo clip, as a node |
| H3 Probe Schedule | `probe_steps` | 6 | run only the head of the baseline; the early x0 feeds the oracle and the init. Raise it if the init loses choreography |
| H3 Expert Schedule | `base_head` | 2 | split the injected schedule: base-model head for structure, turbo tail for refinement (tail defaults to turbo's native 4 steps) |
| H3 Trajectory Bank | `every_n` | 1 | wraps a sampler and checkpoints the trajectory latent each step (~7 MB per step for a 5 s clip) |
| H3 Trajectory Load | `step` | 5 | resume a banked run from any step with its remaining schedule; swap the model, LoRA, or guider and continue without recomputing the head |

#### Alpha nodes

Added 2026-08-09 and after. These are the research surface: they
work and are documented, but their names, defaults and outputs may
change, and they have had far less playback mileage than the nodes
above. `TESTING_ALPHA.md` is the manual checklist; `ROADMAP.md` and
`RESEARCH_NOTES_ATOS.md` carry the open questions and what we
rejected. If you want the settled pipeline, everything above this
line is it.

| node | knob | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| H3 Motion Editor | timeline, brushes, lanes | | the GUI: time blocks with bracket handles, per-frame mask painting, per-block dials, automation envelopes for hold/feather/strength. Compiles to a hold map and a soft mask; state is plain JSON that agents can author without the GUI |
| H3 Segment Crop | `handle_frames` | 12 | cut the world to the held window plus context handles; the regen chain then pays only for the window. Report output states the speedup |
| H3 Segment Splice | `feather_frames` | 6 | reassemble after recovery: baseline outside, segment inside, video + audio crossfades inside the handles |
| H3 Window Plan (alpha) | `max_dilated_frames` | 209 | per-window budget in smeared frames, the number that sets cost and peak memory; read your card's ceiling off a run that survived |
| | `coverage` | full clip | `full clip` tiles windows over every frame so calm spans are repainted too (they cost 1 dilated frame each and cut cold); `held span` regenerates only where the hold map fires, cheaper, but passed-through frames keep baseline resolution on upscale graphs |
| | `window` | 0 | which window this queue item renders; 0, queue, then 1, queue. The report output is the interface: read it |
| H3 Window Collect (alpha) | `store_dir` | output/h3_windows | windows bank here between queue items and survive a reboot; avoid /tmp, it is a RAM disk on most Linux installs |
| | `run_name` | window_run | keys the banked set; change it whenever the plan changes |
| H3 Conditioning Bank (alpha) | `bank_key` | run | banks the encoded prompt to disk between queue items. Its `conditioning` input is lazy, so on a hit the encode node and the ~15 GB text encoder are never executed. One key per (prompt, reference, canvas, length): only the prompt is fingerprinted for you, and only if you wire it |
| | `mode` | use bank if present | `refresh` re-encodes and overwrites, which is what you press after changing anything the key does not cover |
| H3 Latent Bank (alpha) | `bank_key` | pass1 | same idea one stage later: banks a sampled LATENT so the pass is not re-rendered. Seat it after the pass-1 sampler, where the video decode, the audio decode and the jerk oracle all read from it. Lazy input, so a hit never stages the sampler |
| | `seed`, `fingerprint` | unwired | the ONLY things folded into the filename beyond `bank_key`. Wire the noise seed; put steps, scheduler, LoRA strength and resolution into `fingerprint` yourself |
| | `store_dtype` | float32 (exact) | float16 halves the file and sits below a VAE decode's noise, but it is not bit-identical: keep float32 while you are comparing takes |
| H3 Manual Hold Map | `ranges` | | manual time targeting: `start-end[:hold]` pairs, frames or seconds. Wire the oracle's hold_map in and its holds survive only inside your ranges (gate mode); leave it unwired to author holds directly. The report output prices the regeneration before you run it |
| H3 V2V Init | `freeze_threshold` | 0 (off) | automatic background freeze, not recommended: it fixes background timing but degraded other artifacts in our playback tests. Kept for content where the trade goes the other way |
| | `mask`, `mask_feather` | off, 0 | manual freeze region: you paint what regenerates (`invert_mask` to paint the frozen background instead). Static union over time, so the boundary never moves. Default is hard latent cells (each ~16 px cell fully frozen or fully live; the decode smooths the edge); raise `mask_feather` for a pixel-space ramp pooled to fractional cells if a seam shows |
| H3 Motion Composite | `mask` | oracle heat | spatial recovery: regenerated pixels inside the mask, baseline outside. The automatic oracle-heat mode stays deprecated for moving background objects (they pop at its boundary); with a hand-drawn mask the seam goes where you hide it, along a real edge |
| H3 Indecision Oracle (experimental) | `mode` | indecision | which signal drives the hold map: `indecision`, `jerk passthrough`, `blend max`, `blend weighted w`. Outputs mirror H3 Jerk Oracle and compile through the same threshold/bridge/ramp code, so the switch changes the signal and nothing else. See below |
| | `step_a`, `step_b` | 6, 12 | which two X0 Tap dumps to difference. 6 to 12 on a 25-step run is the validated pair; 0 to 1 is degenerate |
| | `blend_w` | 0.5 | weight on indecision in `blend weighted w`; blending happens after per-source rank normalization |
| H3 Timeline Analyze (alpha) | `auto` | True | oracle profiles in, a PLAN DOCUMENT out: a per-clip JSON saying in generation densities over time how the shot should be retimed. `auto` compiles the proposal straight to a minted graph; off stops at the plan so you can edit it |
| H3 Timeline Render (alpha) | `plan_path` | | a plan in, a legal graph minted and priced. It emits the graph path and the launch line rather than executing: launching stays with your own queue script |
| H3 Drawn Plan (alpha) | `plan_path`, `plan_json` | | load a plan and get its compiled geometry as wireable outputs: `hold_map` (the compiler's map verbatim, for H3 Temporal Insert), `ranges` (the same map in H3 Manual Hold Map's language, which re-shapes it through that node's own snapping), window start/len, dilated length, guide frame, and a `splice_map` for H3 Segment Splice at feather 0 |
| | `ignore_uncompiled_lanes` | False | a plan may carry lanes this backend cannot compile yet. Off refuses the plan so nothing is dropped silently; on compiles the density lane and names every lane it skipped |
| H3 Plan Settings (alpha) | `plan_path`, `plan_json` | | the same plan's execution knobs as typed outputs: inject, steps, seed, prompt, width, height, output prefix. Wire these instead of retyping them and the graph cannot drift from the plan. `expand_to_end` is reported for reading only: the compiler already baked it into the map, so H3 Temporal Insert stays False |
| H3 Plan Estimate (alpha) | `recorder_path` | flight recorder | what the plan costs before it runs: equivalent clip time (exact from the plan), work units, VRAM band. `seconds` comes back -1 when your box has no recorded runs, because an uncalibrated guess is worse than no answer |
| H3 Repair Plan (alpha) | `bad_start`, `bad_end` | 0, 0 | 0-based inclusive frame range that is wrong. The node snaps it OUTWARD to whole latent time tokens and emits the hold map, the time-varying regenerate mask and the splice bounds |
| | `hold` | 3 | dilation on the repaired span only; set H3 Time Smear's `dilation` to the same number, and its `expand_to_end` off |
| | `shot_cuts`, `cut_reach` | "", 8 | 0-based first frame of each new shot. A cut inside the span, or within `cut_reach` of its end, becomes the exit: the splice hands back to the original AT the cut |
| H3 Repair Splice (alpha) | `plan` | | frame selection, nothing resampled or blended. Asserts that every frame outside the splice is bit-identical to the original, and prints entry/exit seam deltas next to the original's own delta at the same frames |
| H3 DyRoPE (experimental) | `mode` | physical_blocks | which blocks or steps see the physical (true-duration) grid instead of the stock uniform one. `physical_all` reproduces H3 True Clock, `compact_all` reproduces having no node at all |
| | `block_lo`, `block_hi` | 0, 24 | the block range for the `*_blocks` modes. Two recommended doses, neither a default: 30-49 (timing-fidelity, slight flicker in the span) and 40-49 (minimal shimmer, can read over-smooth on some content) |
| | `fade_end` | 0.5 | for the `fade_*` modes: the sigma at which the interpolation completes. 0.7 is the recommended fade dose; 0.8 is already past the benefit boundary |
| H3 V2V Init | `audio_prefix_ticks` | 0 (off) | (alpha) freeze the first n audio-latent ticks to the seeded `audio_latent`. A 39-frame carried handle is exactly 65 ticks. Needs `audio_latent` wired |
| | `audio_prefix_release_ticks` | 0 | (alpha) half-cosine release over the last n ticks of the frozen prefix instead of a hard edge; 8 ticks (0.2 s) is the upstream lineage's tested recipe |
| H3 Drift Control (alpha) | `prefix_frames` | 39 | schedule-matched noise on a chained segment's carried VIDEO prefix, tapering to exact at the seam end. 39 frames = 12 latent steps = `matched_steps` 8 + `taper_steps` 4, and those two must sum to the prefix's step count |
| H3 Delta Color Carry (alpha) | `strength` | 0.50 | adds only E(corrected) - E(original) to the carried prefix, so the encode bias cancels and only the grade survives. Inert until the two stats inputs differ |
| H3 Scene Color Stats (alpha) | | | centre-weighted luma/saturation percentiles of a frame batch as JSON, for the node above |

#### The indecision oracle (experimental, 2026-08-14)

A second, independent oracle. The jerk oracle reads a clip's motion out
of a finished latent; this one reads the model's own uncertainty out of
two mid-schedule x0 predictions:

    J[token] = avgpool2x2( mean over the 24 latent channels of |x0_b - x0_a| )

High J means tokens whose predicted clean latent is still moving between
denoise steps, i.e. where the model has not made up its mind. A desk
study over 7 scenes found it carries genuinely independent signal:
controlling for pixel motion it still correlates +0.41 with static
detail energy, and on the quietest third of token-times (where
frame-diff has nothing to say) +0.51. It also misses things the jerk
oracle catches: one fast swinging prop read motion rank 0.97 and jitter
rank 0.04. The two disagree in both directions, so `blend max` is the
recommended experiment rather than a straight substitution.

**Nothing else in the pack changed its defaults.** This node exists so
the comparison can be made on real renders first.

Wiring the A/B:

1. Pass 1 goes through `X0 Tap (SAMPLER wrapper)` from `h3-motion-lab`
   with `dump_steps` including both steps you want (`6,12` at minimum).
2. Wire the pass-1 latent into `samples` and the tap's `dump_dir` into
   `dump_dir`, and set `length`/`width`/`height` to the tapped clip.
3. Wire `hold_map` where you would have wired the jerk oracle's, and
   flip `mode` to compare. `jerk passthrough` reproduces H3 Jerk Oracle
   exactly (unit-tested for byte-identical output), so the A/B is one
   widget and not two graphs.
4. Read the `comparison` output for the overlap and divergence numbers,
   and preview `heat` for the side-by-side map (indecision left, jerk
   right; wire `images` to get it overlaid on frames instead of tiles).

Two traps the node shouts about in its report:

- **The cheap pair is the useless one.** Step 0 to 1 is dominated by the
  (1,4,4,4,4) chunk-phase ramp, not by content, and correlated at or
  below zero with the picture on 6 of 7 test scenes.
- **Masked, pinned and repaint runs give you a picture of the mask.**
  Composited token rows read as exactly zero jitter. If more than 30% of
  token rows are exactly zero the report says so in capitals; believe it
  and do not drive a hold map off that map.

Some graphs tap `0,1,12,24` rather than including 6. There 12 to 24 is
the usable pair. With `auto_fallback` on (default) the node picks the
closest available pair and puts what it did in the report; turn it off
to hard-fail on a mis-tapped graph instead.
| | `feather_profile`, `feather_direction` | linear, centered | seam control: linear/smoothstep/gaussian falloff; centered straddles the boundary, inward eats into the masked side, outward into the kept side |

### What to expect, time-wise

Measured on a 5 second 1024x1024 clip at about 11.5 s/step (RTX PRO 6000);
scale to your card and clip:

| path | time | what you get |
|---|---|---|
| starting point, turbo pass 2 (`examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json`) | ~12 min for 192 frames at 1 MP; the same graph at 25 steps both passes without turbo is ~36 | the normal finals since 2026-08-19 |
| pipeline, inject 0.70 (`examples/motion_pipeline.json`) | ~19 min incl. its own baseline | the slow finals: 25 steps both passes, base model throughout |
| pipeline, inject 0.50 (`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_i50.json`) | ~15 min incl. baseline | sharper, tracks the source motion closer; try both |
| probe + expert turbo (`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_probe_expert.json`) | ~8.5 min, no full baseline | the fast full de-rope; preview output is intentionally rough |
| featherweight (`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_featherweight.json`, ComfyUI 0.31+) | 4-6 min for 3 s clips; ~29 min for 5 s at 1.0 MP | the 24-32 GB card path; fits where int8 thrashes. See TUNING for measured peaks |
| split LoRA pass 1 (`examples/archive/motion_pipeline_split_lora.json`) | ~7.5 min at 1.5 MP | most motion retained of the pass-1 recipes we measured |
| upscale de-rope (`examples/motion_pipeline_upscale_derope.json`) | ~6.75 min at 0.4 -> 1.5 MP | 89% of native detail, 83% of the time |
| fast iterate (`examples/motion_pipeline_fast_iterate.json`) | ~95 s at 0.2 -> 0.4 MP | prompt and choreography loop, not a final |

The rows pointing into `examples/archive/` are earlier recipes, kept so
these numbers still resolve; start from the live graphs.

Start with a short clip, 2 to 3 seconds, and scale up once you like what
you see. Durations snap to the model's legal frame counts automatically
(the closest ones are 1.6 s, 2.3 s, and 3.0 s at 24fps), a short clip
keeps VRAM and wait times friendly, and how far you scale is really a
question of how much fast action the clip contains: cost follows the
burst spans, not the runtime.

A tuning guide for all of this, written for humans and for AI assistants
working on a user's behalf, is in [`TUNING.md`](TUNING.md).

Where the method is honestly weak, and what we are doing about it, is split
across two documents: [`RESEARCH_NOTES_ATOS.md`](RESEARCH_NOTES_ATOS.md) for
what has been measured (including the finding that the oracle can rank but
cannot abstain), and [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the methods under
investigation, what would count as success for each, and the approaches we
tried and rejected.

### bridge and inject

Both settings change the output in ways that are a preference, not a
ranking. From same-seed comparisons on our test clips:

- `bridge: 8` (default): the hold plateau covers each burst fully.
  Sharpest output, motion tracking equal to uniform dilation, about 2.9x
  frame budget. Poses can drift slightly from the baseline (a head angle
  on a landing, that kind of thing).
- `bridge: 0`: holds follow the raw oracle curve. Closest to the
  baseline's poses; a few soft frames can remain where the curve dips
  inside a burst.
- no hold_map (uniform `dilation: 4`): most conservative, highest cost.
- `inject 0.70` vs `0.50`: 0.50 measured sharper with closer motion
  tracking on our clips; 0.70 has been the safer default in playback.
  Try both on your content.

### Manual spatial masks, or: the birds

Time warping overcranks steady background movers (birds, crowds,
traffic) inside dilated spans, and both automatic remedies failed our
playback bar: compositing on the oracle's own heat mask popped at the
boundary, and the latent freeze degraded other artifacts. The
mechanisms were fine; the mask author wasn't. The oracle cannot hide a
seam. You can, by lassoing the sky down to a rooftop line and letting
the feather blend along an edge where nothing moves.

So both mechanisms now take a hand-drawn MASK. On the demo clip, whose
regeneration invented an extra flock and a small pagoda, a two-box
keep-baseline mask (`invert_mask` on) returned both regions to the
baseline take and kept the regenerated subject, seam along the cloud
deck. Prefer the composite (pixel space, fine feather control) unless
background and subject share lighting or contact, then use the V2V
Init freeze (latent space, coarser feather, but the model renders the
interaction). A single mask is a static boundary and cannot pop by
construction; mask batches are supported for per-frame control but
bring the moving-boundary risk back, so feather harder and judge in
playback.

### Notes on the approach

- A reference conditions every step at full strength and will copy the
  source's artifacts. An init decays with noise: at `inject 0.70` the
  baseline's smear detail is destroyed while its coarse motion survives.
- The model's clock stays uniform. The slowdown exists only in the
  content, as a speed ramp, so there is no boundary where the DiT and the
  VAE disagree about time. (Warping the RoPE time axis directly was
  tried; it produced boundary stutter.)
- Holds are integer, so recovering the original frame rate is exact frame
  selection.

### Dialogue through a de-rope

If your clip has speech in it, the de-rope will break it, and the way it
breaks is not obvious from the output.

Here is what happens. The de-rope stretches time, regenerates, then
compresses back. The picture goes along with that: the smeared init tells
pass 2 to move slowly, and it does. The audio has no init. It starts from
zeros, so pass 2 writes a fresh performance at natural speaking rate and
moves the mouth to match that. Recovery then compresses the whole clip by
the hold factor. The body comes back at the right speed because it really
was slowed. The mouth does not, because it never was. On a clip that
dilated 2.4x, held regions come back sounding rushed while the tail sounds
fine, which is a confusing symptom because half the clip is correct.

The fix is to give the audio an init too. `H3 Audio Smear` stretches the
baseline track onto the same dilated clock the video init lives on, using
the same hold map. Encode that with `VAEEncodeAudio`, wire it into
`H3 V2V Init`'s `audio_latent`, and set `audio_mode` to
`follow the original performance (0.5)`. Pass 2 now renders a genuinely
slowed take, so compressing it afterwards is a valid thing to do.

Two graphs ship with this, both full-reference mode:
[`motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va_audioinit.json)
has the seed wired and writes both audio routes as separate finals, and
[`motion_pipeline_ref2va.json`](examples/motion_pipeline_ref2va.json) is the
same graph without it, kept as the archived version. Diff the two if you
would rather read the change than follow the steps below.

**To adopt it in a graph you already have, add three things:**

1. `H3 Audio Smear` -- `audio` from the VAEDecodeAudio of your FIRST pass
   (the baseline performance, not pass 2's), `hold_map` from the same
   `H3 Time Smear` output you already feed to `H3 Audio Recover`, `fps` 24.
2. `VAEEncodeAudio` -- audio from the smear, vae is your audio VAE.
3. On `H3 V2V Init`, wire `audio_latent` from that encode and set
   `audio_mode` to `follow the original performance (0.5)`.

Nothing else changes. Both new inputs are optional and default to the old
behaviour, so a graph without them behaves exactly as it did before.

**Which audio to ship.** `H3 Audio Recover` now takes plain-language
options instead of a bare 0 to 1 dial, because the two ends mean different
things depending on whether you seeded the rows:

- `keep the original performance (safe default)` is the one to use. Your
  first pass's audio is already on the world clock and has never been
  through a vocoder, so it is the best-sounding track you have. The seed's
  job is to make the picture agree with it.
- `use pass 2's foley - ONLY IF the audio rows were seeded` gives you
  foley scored for the new motion. Without a seed this is the rushed
  defect described above. With one it is a real option, though it comes
  back thinner: two phase-vocoder passes and a VAE round trip cost about a
  third of the presence band between 3.4 and 8 kHz.

**What it costs the picture: nothing measurable.** Same graph with and
without the seed, everything else held, came out 91.8 against 91.3 on
laplacian variance, which is inside the noise floor of the video encoder
itself. It moves most pixels, because it is steering a joint audio-video
latent and the two halves are denoised together, but it does not soften.

**Where this has and has not been tested.** It has been run on a handful
of clips, all sword-fight material with two speakers trading lines over
fast motion, at hold factors around 4 and dilations from 2.4x to 2.7x.
It has not been tried on a single speaker, on speech over music, on
non-anime footage, or at other hold factors. Treat it as alpha, and
listen to the tail of a clip as well as the start, because the tail is
where an unheld region will sound normal whether or not anything is wrong.

### The motion adapter (pilot)

A rank-16 LoRA trained on the de-rope task itself: frames inside a motion
burst held out, the rest kept as clean context, the model asked to fill
the burst back in. Applied to the de-rope pass only, it teaches the base
model to spend the stretched clock on smoothness instead of invention.
Weights and the measurement write-up:
[huggingface.co/matlowai/MiniMax-H3-Motion-Adapter](https://huggingface.co/matlowai/MiniMax-H3-Motion-Adapter).
Graphs: [`examples/experimental/motion_pipeline_adapter_api.json`](examples/experimental/motion_pipeline_adapter_api.json)
(text to video, then the standard de-rope with one `LoraLoaderModelOnly`
on the pass-2 model) and
[`examples/experimental/motion_window_pinned_adapter_api.json`](examples/experimental/motion_window_pinned_adapter_api.json)
(a clip you already have: the window is regenerated at denoise 0.70 with
its first and last frames pinned, adapter on the pass-2 model; this is the
graph behind the demo page's headline quad). Clips on the
[demo page](https://matlowai.github.io/ComfyUI-MAINodes/#adapter).

Settings, measured on clips it never saw: strength 1.0 (strength and
inject are the same dial; 1.0 wins alternation in every paired cell);
inject is what you tune, 0.45 for character work where the base
over-produces, 0.30 where identity or props are the deliverable, anything
on very fast anime; keep the tail guide on. Known costs: about 1 dB of
anchor fidelity on native keyframes, over-correction of calm chains, and
muted colour on strong-colour or particle-heavy subjects, worst on the
Ref2VA checkpoint and on full-clip 3x passes (a prismatic creature came
out as a plain calico both ways). It is a pilot released as an intermediate option; a
more ambitious all-in-one adapter is in progress and may not work.

### Repairing a few bad frames

Sometimes a finished clip is fine except for half a second of it. Repair is
the bilateral sibling of the extension nodes: extension asks what comes
after a clip, repair says these frames are wrong, render them again, and
give the clip back with only those frames different.

`H3 Repair Plan` does the arithmetic. You give it the clip length, the bad
frame range (0-based, inclusive) and a hold, and it emits four things: a
hold map for `H3 Time Smear`, a time-varying regenerate mask for
`H3 V2V Init` in DILATED coordinates, the splice bounds, and a report that
prices the pass. `H3 Repair Splice` then reassembles: original pixels
outside the splice, repaired pixels inside, nothing resampled and nothing
blended.

Two rules run through both nodes, and they pull in opposite directions:

- **Masks snap to tokens.** A latent time token cannot be half
  regenerated, so the regenerate mask has to cover whole tokens. Frames
  group in 17s, each group is 5 tokens covering (1, 4, 4, 4, 4) frames, so
  "frames 45 to 47 are wrong" becomes "regenerate 43 to 50".
- **Splices are free.** Reassembly is pure frame selection and may cut
  anywhere. So extend the mask where the grid forces it, then choose the
  splice points for picture reasons: enter in quiet motion, and exit ON a
  shot cut whenever one is near.

The cut rule is the one that earns its keep. On the validation clip the
token snap pushed the regenerated span across a hard cut and the model
reinvented the first frames of the next shot; the exit seam popped at 2.6x
the clip's median frame delta. Extending the mask through the cut did not
fix it (2.3x). Handing back to the original AT its own cut did. Type the
cut into `shot_cuts` and the plan carries the mask through it while the
splice exits on it, so the seam becomes the edit the shot always had.

Measured on that cell (90 frames, bad 45 to 47, hold 3, cut at 53): entry
seam 3.99/255, which is 0.26x the clip's median frame delta; exit 138.04
against the original's own 135.57 at the same cut, a difference of 1.8%;
maximum absolute pixel difference outside the splice 0, asserted by the
node. The plan's own entry check called frame 43 quiet (2.0 against a
median of 15.2). `tests/test_repair_plan.py` pins that arithmetic and runs
on CPU with no models.

**AUDIO IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS for the repair verb.** The video splice
is frame-exact; audio handling across the splice is not yet finished.
`H3 Repair Splice` passes an AUDIO input straight through, untouched and
the same length, which is right when the repair did not change the
performance and is not a general answer. Repair picture, keep your original
track, and do not expect the node to solve a repaired line of dialogue yet.

Two things to set on the rest of the graph: `H3 Time Smear`'s `dilation`
must equal the plan's `hold`, and its `expand_to_end` must be OFF, because
an end-expansion rewrite moves every dilated coordinate the plan just
computed. The plan says so in its report if it detects the case.

### DyRoPE: who gets the true clock

`H3 True Clock` tells the model the true world duration of a time-smeared
clip, and it works: background agents hold world speed through a held span.
It was also measured to cost seam flash (7.17x against a control's 1.87x)
and jitter (5.06x against 0.85x), because the same non-uniform time grid
goes to all 50 blocks at every step, and that is off-distribution.

`H3 DyRoPE` splits the two geometries apart so they can be handed out
selectively. Physical is True Clock's grid, compact is the stock uniform
grid the model was trained on. `physical_all` reproduces True Clock exactly
and `compact_all` reproduces having no node in the graph at all; those are
the identity arms. The `*_blocks` modes give a named block range one
geometry and every other block the other, and the `fade_*` modes give every
block one interpolated grid per step, as a function of sigma, complete at
`fade_end`.

What a twelve-arm dose ladder on one clip says, meters first:

| arm | flash | jitter |
|---|---|---|
| stock clock everywhere (control) | 2.09x | 1.77x |
| physical everywhere (= True Clock) | 8.14x | 2.93x |
| physical in blocks 0-9 only | 7.84x | 2.95x |
| physical in blocks 25-49 only | 1.87x | 2.61x |
| physical in blocks 30-49 only | 1.84x | 2.33x |
| physical in blocks 40-49 only | 1.94x | 1.39x |
| fade to stock by sigma 0.3 | 1.76x | 2.72x |
| fade to stock by sigma 0.7 | 1.80x | 2.06x |
| stock at high sigma, physical by sigma 0.5 | 2.58x | 8.32x |

Two readings. **Flash is an early-block effect**: ten early blocks with
true time reproduce the whole True Clock flash, and every arm that keeps
true time out of blocks 0-9 sits at the control's level. **Jitter is a dose
effect**: it scales with how much physical-time exposure the run gets, once
the early blocks are excluded.

The meters cannot pick the winner, though, because they say nothing about
whether an arm still delivers what the true clock was FOR. Playback maps a
benefit boundary the meters do not see: world timing survives at blocks
40-49 for all steps, and at all blocks above sigma 0.7, and at every larger
dose. It dies at `fade_end` 0.8 (the window gets too short), and at any
block restriction stacked on top of the sigma window. Every attempt to cut
jitter below those two doses lost the timing.

So there are two settings worth recommending, and neither is a winner. They
trade the same two things against each other, and which one is right is a
property of your clip. Neither is a code default; the node ships with its
defaults unchanged.

- **`physical_blocks` 30-49, the timing-fidelity setting.** The held span
  holds world speed neutrally, without over- or undershooting it. The cost
  is a slight flicker or hitch inside the span (this dose metered 2.33x
  jitter against the stock control's 1.77x).
- **`physical_blocks` 40-49, the minimal-shimmer setting.** The smoothest
  span of the pair and the cleanest meters on the board (1.17x to 1.39x
  jitter across three takes, always below the stock control). On some
  content it slightly overshoots the correction, so the span can read
  over-smooth or slowed.
- **`fade_physical_to_compact` at `fade_end 0.7` is the flash-free
  alternative.** No flash at all in playback, visible jitter (2.06x to
  2.87x across takes), timing held.
- The mechanism to keep in mind while you choose: **less dose than these
  loses the world-time correction entirely, more dose adds shimmer.** There
  is no setting that is quieter than 40-49 and still on time; every arm
  tried below these doses came back on the stock clock's speed.
- The failure being fixed is worth naming, because it is easy to mistake
  for a de-rope defect: on the stock clock a dilated span PLAYS
  ACCELERATED. Background agents in the held region move too fast, because
  the model was told the span is shorter than it really is.

`H3 DyRoPE` is not composable with `H3 Streamed Blocks` in the `*_blocks`
modes: both own the double-block replacement slot and ComfyUI keeps one per
block. The capability probe reports the collision. The fade modes use no
block patches and compose fine.

The clips these numbers came from are on the public deck:
<https://matlowai.github.io/flipbook/trueclock.html>.

### Anchoring audio across a join (alpha)

`H3 V2V Init`'s `audio_strength` is one number for the whole track.
`audio_prefix_ticks` makes it a shape: the first n audio-latent ticks are
frozen to the seeded `audio_latent` content (noise mask 0 there), and every
later tick keeps `audio_strength`. That is the audio twin of the video
prefix freeze, and it is what lets a continuation carry the previous
segment's sound into the new one instead of starting a new performance.

The four things to know before wiring it:

- **It needs `audio_latent` wired.** With nothing seeded there is nothing
  to freeze to, and the setting does nothing but confuse the log. The tick
  clock is the audio latent's, not the video's: a 39-frame carried handle
  is exactly 65 ticks.
- **An AddGuide AUDIO guide and `ref_audios` cannot coexist.** They collide
  in conditioning-audio packing. (Measured on core 82f839f5; treat as a current-core rule, not a model property.) Pick one route for a graph and stay on it.
- **`audio_prefix_release_ticks` changes what assembly has to do.** With a
  release above 0 the last n ticks of the frozen prefix ramp from 0 up to
  `audio_strength` on a half cosine instead of cutting hard (8 ticks, 0.2
  s, is the upstream lineage's tested recipe). If you use it, the assembly step must let the
  CONTINUATION own the overlap tail, or the trim throws the ramp away and
  you paid for nothing.
- **Scope: it carries local continuity, not structure.** Level, timbre and
  beat come across the join. It does not carry global phrase structure. A
  longer handle helps at the seam (90 frames measured 0.953 overlap
  correlation vs 0.92 at 39) and gives the model a full musical phrase of
  context, but only a pinned master track GUARANTEES the structure; that
  guarantee is by construction.

Alpha, and the honest reading is that this has been exercised on a narrow
slice of material. Both inputs default to 0 and the scalar path is
unchanged at that value, so a graph without them behaves exactly as it did
before.

### Chained segments: drift and colour (alpha)

Two different things decay when you chain segments, and they have separate
nodes.

**`H3 Drift Control`** attacks clean-conditioning error. A chained
segment's carried prefix is bit-clean, which one seam loves and a chain
does not: repeated clean conditioning accumulates contrast and texture
error, and a seam probe watches the join decay from about 0.9 at the first
join to about 0.65 by the second across every variant tested. The node
gives the disposable carried VIDEO prefix a small, schedule-matched amount
of the sampler's own noise at every model evaluation, tapering to exact at
the seam end, so the model never treats the prefix as impossibly clean.
Audio is deliberately untouched: the frozen per-tick audio prefix stays
hard.

What it demands, all of which it enforces rather than guesses:

- `prefix_frames` must equal the plan's handle and sit on the 17k+5 grid.
  39 frames is 12 latent steps, and `matched_steps` + `taper_steps` must
  sum to exactly that (8 + 4 is the field-validated recipe).
- The latent must already carry a noise mask: wire `H3 V2V Init` first. The
  node rewrites that mask, it does not create one.
- It **refuses to stack** on another dynamic denoise-mask patch. Two of
  them cannot share the model.
- Sigma-split samplers are not supported; our graphs run one
  `SamplerCustomAdvanced` per pass.
- **Replicated across two chains and new seeds.** Joins hold 0.85-0.89
  through link 4 on the newer chain; the earlier chain, before this node,
  fell to the 0.65 class by its second join. That is a cross-chain
  comparison, not a paired drift-off arm. The matched+taper recipe itself
  is still one recipe, not a swept space.

**`H3 Delta Color Carry`** (with `H3 Scene Color Stats`) attacks the other
decay: every carried handle is a VAE round trip, each round trip darkens
about 2.4%, and chains accumulate it. Rather than regrading the sampled
latent, it decodes the prefix once, applies a weak scene-one
exposure/saturation correction in RGB, encodes BOTH the original and the
corrected frames, and adds only E(corrected) - E(original) to the latent.
The encode bias appears in both terms and cancels; only the intended grade
survives. The delta is spatially low-passed and tapered from zero at the
old edge to full strength beside the generated future, and audio is never
touched. Wire the delivered tail of scene one through one
`H3 Scene Color Stats` into `anchor_stats`, the current predecessor's tail
through another into `current_stats`, and the node between the extend
graph's `VAEEncode` and `H3 V2V Init`. On the first link the two stats are
the same tail, the transform is the identity, and the latent passes
through untouched.

Status, stated plainly: Active path exercised on a real 4-link render 2026-08-24: it fires, corrects in the anchor direction, and stays sub-visible under its clamps on mildly-drifted content; on the deepest tested link it fires on both channels at or near its clamp. A strong-drift bench (where the 2.4% per-round-trip signature actually accrues) is still owed.

Both nodes are adapted, with permission of the licence, from
ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Contex-Loop (GPL-3.0, the same licence as this pack):
Drift Control from its Drift-Control AV, Delta Color Carry from its
Color-Stable Drift AV. The per-module credit lines in `h3_drift.py` and
`h3_color_carry.py` say exactly what was taken and what was deliberately
not ported.

### Retiming part of a clip (window mode)

When only an excerpt of a long clip needs retiming, the graph passes the
rest through untouched and expands the excerpt. That shape is worth its own
page, because the window is encoded in four coupled places (two crops, the
hold map, and the regeneration's conditioning length) and editing three of
them produces a broken render whose damage sits at the OLD boundary. Window
starts also quantize to a 17-frame lattice, 0.708 s at 24 fps, which is why
"start at second 1" is not a thing the graph can do.

The arithmetic, the failure signature and the procedure are in
[docs/WINDOW_MODE.md](docs/WINDOW_MODE.md).

## Contact-Sheet diffusion

Five standalone image latents packed on the model's time axis, jointly
denoised, decoded independently. Use with a Turnaround LoRA from
[matlod/minimax-h3-turnaround](https://huggingface.co/matlod/minimax-h3-turnaround).
Nodes: **H3 Contact Sheet**, **H3 Contact Sheet Decode**.
Drag-in workflow: [`examples/contact_sheet.json`](examples/contact_sheet.json)
(API twin alongside) — point the LoadImage at your reference image, pick
your downloaded LoRA file, queue. `ref_image` is optional: leave it
unconnected for a text-only sheet (drop the `<Picture 1>` tag from the
prompt); [`examples/contact_sheet_t2i.json`](examples/contact_sheet_t2i.json)
is that graph. Stock loaders and sampler throughout;
28 steps of res_multistep at denoise 1.0, LoRA strength 0.75. A scripted
example is in [`example_api_workflow.py`](example_api_workflow.py).
Previously published as ComfyUI-H3-ContactSheet; that repo remains up for
existing installs.

## Alpha work

This pack ships finished work and unfinished work in the same install.
The Motion Lab pipeline and the contact sheet above are the finished part.
Alongside them are a research subsystem (Concept Lab), a timeline surface,
the audio init for dialogue, the motion adapter pilot, and the manual mask
paths, all at varying degrees of unfinished.

**[ALPHA.md](ALPHA.md) says which is which**, what each one can and cannot
do today, and where each has and has not been tested. Alpha nodes carry
`(alpha)` in the ComfyUI menu, they load behind a guarded loader so a
broken one cannot take the pack down, and none of them changes existing
behaviour or defaults.

## Comparing a batch of renders

[`tools/compare_deck/`](tools/compare_deck/) builds the review page used for
the sweeps in this pack: a manifest JSON in, one self-contained HTML file
out, with a card grid, a sortable metric table, a synced A/B (side by side
or wipe) on a waveform timeline, and a frame-exact export of the current
view. `make_manifest.py` drafts the manifest from a folder of clips; you
fill in the groups and descriptions. The clips stay where they are, so
nothing but HTML is produced. A live deck built with it:
<https://matlowai.github.io/flipbook/trueclock.html>. Standalone Python, no
ComfyUI import, see [`tools/compare_deck/README.md`](tools/compare_deck/README.md).

**MAI Video Compare** is the same review surface inside ComfyUI, and it grew
into a full player. Wire 2 to 6 renders into the node and queue once: it
writes each one as a small h264 preview (CPU, no VAE, no tensors kept) and
the widget plays them as live `<video>` elements, so it costs no VRAM.
Driving it, once the previews load:

- **Pick the pair.** Keys 1 to 6 choose sources (the last two pressed are A
  and B), and the mode buttons switch between side by side, flip, wipe and,
  for more than two, a synchronized grid. Hover a source to hear it, click
  to lock its audio there.
- **Move together.** Space plays and pauses everything, the arrows step one
  frame (shift steps 12), F flickers A against B. All sources stay on the
  lead's clock.
- **Loop the moment that matters.** The timeline draws the A side's stereo
  waveform, and the loop brackets are always live: `i` and `o` set them from
  the playhead, or drag the grab tabs, or double-click to reset to the whole
  clip. Playback stays inside the brackets, which is how you watch one seam
  fifty times without touching anything.
- **Let the graph mark it up.** Wire `H3 Time Smear`'s `hold_map_used` into
  the node's `hold_map` and the regenerated window is drawn as a band with
  enter and exit blips as the playhead crosses it. `curves` takes
  `{name: [per-frame floats]}` and draws each as a lane under the playhead.
  Both inputs are optional and were appended last, so older graphs keep
  their widget order.
- **Keep the verdict.** Enter stars the B side, which sets the node's
  `winner` widget; the NEXT queue passes that source through `winner_video`
  and `winner_index`. Pick, then finalize in a second execution: a graph
  never waits on a human mid-run.
- **Export what you just watched.** The export button renders the current
  pair, in the current mode, over the current loop, plus a two second end
  card carrying each side's label, seed, frame count, fps and size. It is
  frame-exact through WebCodecs (VP9, AV1 or H.264, up to 100 Mbps, Opus
  audio) and falls back to real-time capture where WebCodecs or the muxers
  are unavailable, which the dialog says before you press anything. The two
  muxers are vendored under `web/vendor/` (MIT, see its README).
- The gear panel holds the rest: region edit, the frame counter overlay, and
  which blips fire. Its settings are per node and survive a reload.

Known issues (alpha): in-node playback sync between sources is
approximate and can drift or stagger, and scrubbing during playback can
wedge the transport (re-queue or reload recovers). In clock sync mode
audio follows only the clock-owning side, so locking audio to the other
pane is silent until sync mode is flipped. The realtime export records
audio from the locked side even when it is not one of the two playing
panes; prefer the precise export. The standalone deck
pages (`tools/compare_deck/`) are the reliable review surface today; a
combined-single-stream preview that removes the sync problem by
construction is the planned next iteration.

## Install

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/matlowai/ComfyUI-MAINodes
```

**The example graphs also need [ComfyUI-KJNodes](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-KJNodes).**
They use `PathchSageAttentionKJ`,
`MiniMaxH3MemoryEfficientSageAttentionPatch` and `MiniMaxChunkFeedForward`
from it. Without KJNodes a graph loads with those three missing and will
not run. The nodes in this pack themselves have no such dependency.

Restart ComfyUI. Nodes appear under `latent/minimax/motion`,
`image/minimax/motion`, and `sampling/custom_sampling/schedulers`.

## Support MAINodes

MAINodes is free and open source. If it saved you time, fixed a workflow
or made something cool possible, you can help fund the next round of GPU
time, benchmarking and increasingly questionable experiments:

- [Support MAINodes on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/matlowai)
- Or just star the repo; that helps too.

## De-rope for any model (branch `generic-derope`)

One hold map, any regenerating model: `H3 Clock Remap` retimes the oracle's
plan onto a model's clock from a preset (`minimax-h3`, `ltx-2.5`, a
user-editable registry for the rest), `H3 Time Smear` pads to that model's
grid, and `H3 Save Hold Map` keeps the clock beside the render. The LTX-2.5
graphs behind https://matlowai.github.io/flipbook/derope.html live there too.
See `DEROPE_ANY_MODEL.md`. Alpha, on a branch until the oracle-shaped LTX arm
is measured.
