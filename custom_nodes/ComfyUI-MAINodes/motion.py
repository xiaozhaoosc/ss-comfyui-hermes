# ------------------------------------------------------- indecision oracle
# EXPERIMENTAL (2026-08-14). A second, independent oracle: instead of reading
# the clip's motion out of a finished latent, read the MODEL'S OWN UNCERTAINTY
# out of two x0 taps taken mid-schedule.
#
#   J(a->b)[t,y,x] = avgpool2x2( mean_over_24_channels |x0_b - x0_a| )
#
# High J = tokens whose predicted clean latent is still moving between denoise
# steps, i.e. where the model has not made up its mind.
#
# The math below is PORTED VERBATIM from the desk study that validated it
# (a private benchmarks tree, x0_jitter.py); tests/test_indecision_oracle.py
# asserts parity against that file so the two cannot drift. What the study found (RESULTS.md, 7 scenes):
#
#   - the map is NOT a re-derivation of the jerk oracle. Controlling for pixel
#     motion it still correlates +0.41 with static detail energy; on the
#     quietest third of token-times it correlates +0.51 with detail while
#     frame-diff has nothing to say.
#   - it is also NOT a superset: on kitsune_dash token 21 a fast swinging
#     ofuda reads motion rank 0.974 and jitter rank 0.040. The two oracles
#     disagree in BOTH directions, which is why this node ships with blend
#     modes and why nothing else in the pack changed its defaults.
#   - the cheap pair 0->1 is degenerate: on 6 of 7 fresh runs it correlates at
#     or below zero with anything in the picture, because it is dominated by
#     the (1,4,4,4,4) chunk-phase ramp. Use 6->12 on a 25-step run.
#   - mask-composited / pinned / repaint runs produce a picture of the MASK,
#     not of the model (pr15375 arms: 12 of 22 token rows exactly zero). The
#     degeneracy check below fires on that.

        "Outputs mirror H3 Jerk Oracle exactly (hold_map / segments / window / "

        "nothing else. Two extra outputs: comparison (a text A/B) and heat (a "
        "previewable map).\n\n"
        "WHAT IT NEEDS: pass 1 must have run through X0 Tap with BOTH steps "
        "dumped. The validated pair is 6->12 on a 25-step schedule. 0->1 is "
        "DEGENERATE — it carries the (1,4,4,4,4) chunk-phase ramp, not "
        "content, and correlated at or below zero with the picture on 6 of 7 "
        "test scenes. Several shipped graphs tap 0,1,12,24 only; there 12->24 "
        "is the usable pair (the node lists what it found and can fall back "

# --- DyRoPE: layer-wise / sigma-faded time geometry ------------------------
#
# H3 True Clock rewrites the RoPE t-grid for EVERY block. Measured 2026-08-15
# on the pier cell that bought a real speed correction at the price of seam
# flash (7.17x the arm's own baseline vs 1.87x for the control) and jitter
# (5.06x vs 0.85x); the warped-decode arm moved the decode by 0.8%, so the
# sampler owns the damage. The standing hypothesis is an off-distribution
# penalty from a non-uniform grid fed identically to all 50 blocks.
#
# DyRoPE splits the two geometries apart so they can be given to DIFFERENT
# blocks, or mixed over the denoise schedule:
#   physical = True Clock spans        (true_clock_spans(holds))
#   compact  = the stock uniform grid  (core _video_t_spans, 5/3 * 1,4,4,4,4)
# The rotation table is built once per forward at
# comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:694 and handed to every block, and a
# ``patches_replace["dit"][("double_block", i)]`` patch receives it as
# ``args["rope_freqs"]`` and may substitute it (model.py:697-709) — so a
# per-block table needs no core change. Fade modes need no block patches at
# all: they hand one interpolated table to everybody, per step.
#
# NOTE on where the fade is computed. The packed layout (and with it
# position_ids) is prebuilt ONCE per sampling run in extra_conds
# (comfy/model_base.py:2206-2208), so a per-step geometry cannot ride the
# _video_t_spans patch the way True Clock's does. It rides the rope_freqs
# wrapper instead, which runs once per forward and can rebuild the t column.

        "generates jointly with the video on the truncated schedule — "
        "causally synced foley, the preferred audio source for regenerated "
        "content. length=0 (default) derives the frame count from the latent "

        "a specific grid.\n\n"
        "Background freeze: wire the BASELINE latent into oracle_samples and "
        "set freeze_threshold above 0 to keep everything outside the "
        "oracle's motion region frozen to the smeared init during "
        "generation. Frozen background is held baseline content, so after "
        "exact recovery its timing is exactly the baseline's: background "
        "agents (birds, crowds) cannot speed up. The mask is static over "
        "time, so nothing pops at its boundary. Effects that fly far from "
        "the subject may be clipped by the freeze; lower the threshold or "
        "raise freeze_grow to give them room.\n\n"
        "Manual freeze: wire a MASK instead and YOU choose the boundary "
        "(overrides the oracle path). mask = the region to REGENERATE; "
        "invert_mask flips it so you can paint the background/birds to "
        "freeze directly. By default the mask is unioned over time (static "
        "boundary, never pops) and snapped to HARD latent cells by default "
        "(mask_feather 0): every ~16 px cell is fully frozen or fully "
        "live, no half-frozen blend cells, and the decode smooths the "
        "edge. Set mask_feather above 0 to get the old pixel-space ramp "
        "pooled to fractional cells if a hard seam ever shows. Prefer "
        "this over the composite node when background and subject share "
        "lighting, shadows or water contact.\n\n"
        "time_varying (manual mask only): keeps the mask's time axis "
        "instead of unioning it, so the freeze region can move or switch "
        "on partway. Transitions QUANTIZE to the latent token grid: each "
        "17 pixel frames are 5 tokens covering (1, 4, 4, 4, 4) frames, so "
        "a change lands on the token that covers it and a token "
        "regenerates if ANY frame it covers is marked regenerate. A moving "
        "boundary CAN pop at those steps - that is the tradeoff for the "
        "default's promise. Put intended transitions on 17-frame phase "
        "(frames 0, 17, 34, ...), where the singleton tokens hold exactly "
        "one frame each and the step is tightest. Masks whose frame count "
        "differs from the clip length are nearest-neighbour resampled "
        "first; a 2D or single-frame mask behaves as before.\n\n"
        "AUDIO ROWS (alpha): by default they start from zeros, so pass 2 "
        "invents its own performance at NATURAL rate and drags the mouth to "
        "match it. On a de-roped clip that is the whole dialogue defect - "
        "recovery then compresses those lips (and, at reference_mix 0, that "

# Track 2 of the latent-resident roadmap (idea 23): do the retime IN LATENT
# SPACE. Instead of duplicating PIXEL frames and paying a VAE encode of the
# longer clip, expand the video latent along t onto the dilated token grid,
# fill the inserted token-times by interpolating the base tokens, and hand the
# sampler a repaint mask that FREEZES the originals so only the in-betweens
# are generated.

# The map below is PORTED, not re-derived, from the T2a fidelity probe
# (ComfyUI-ModelCatalog benchmarks/scripts/tinterp/analyze_tinterp.py:
# token_spans / smear_index / base_time_of_smear_tokens / lerp_tokens), whose
# worked token map is checked in as token_map.csv and is pinned row-for-row by
# tests/test_temporal_insert.py. What T2a measured, and what it decided here
# [MEAS 2026-08-15, one clip, hold 2 x 34 frames, fp16 VAE]:
#   - plain lerp of the base latent matches the encode of the pixel-smeared
#     clip at corr 0.888 / nRMSE 0.44 std (noise null 0.00 / 1.42) and DECODES
#     as motion-blur-like ghosting, not garbage. Nearest, phase-aware and
#     box-overlap variants bought nothing, so lerp is the only mode offered.
#   - token-times landing exactly on a base token centre come back EXACTLY
#     (corr 1.0); off-anchor singletons are the worst case (0.75). Those exact
#     hits are bit-copied here and frozen by the mask.
#   - inserted tokens want sigma >= ~0.5 of denoise (break-even against the
#     interpolation residual is 0.305; at inject 0.7 the residual is 19% of

        "neighbouring base tokens, and emits a repaint mask that freezes "
        "every original token (0) and regenerates only the in-betweens (1). "

        "an expansion span jumps back to real time at the clip end. With the "
        "toggle on, that span is run through the last world frame and the "
        "length is put back on the 17k+5 grid inside the same span (rates "
        "rise toward the end when legality asks for it). Uniform maps, maps "
        "already ending inside an expansion, and rate-1-only maps are "
        "untouched, and so is any rate-1 tail longer than 17 world frames "

        "console and named in the report.\n\n"

# imperfectly-correlated noise realisations and lands smoother than a real
# token at that position. Per element, with neighbour variances v_lo / v_hi
# and noise correlation rho,
#
#     Var(init) = (1-w)^2 v_lo + w^2 v_hi + 2 w (1-w) rho sqrt(v_lo v_hi)
#
# while a genuine token there would carry, interpolating its neighbours'
# dispersion the same way its content is interpolated,
#
#     v_tgt = (1-w) v_lo + w v_hi
#
# Subtract, and rho and the square root collapse into one thing that is
# actually ON THE TENSOR - the neighbour RESIDUAL:
#
#     deficit = v_tgt - Var(init)
#             = w (1-w) [v_lo + v_hi - 2 rho sqrt(v_lo v_hi)]
#             = w (1-w) * Var(x_hi - x_lo)                              (*)
#
# (*) is why nothing here has to ASSUME a correlation: the deficit is measured
# directly, per inserted token and per channel, from the residual between the
# two bracketing tokens. rho is then RECOVERED for the report,
#     rho = (v_lo + v_hi - Var(x_hi - x_lo)) / (2 sqrt(v_lo v_hi)),
# and never used to size anything. Sanity check on (*): put v_lo = v_hi = v
# and w = 0.5 and it gives Var(init) = v (1 + rho) / 2, deficit = v (1 - rho)/2
# - the (1+rho)/2 law, as the symmetric special case.
#
# noise_topup scales the fresh gaussian's VARIANCE (std = sqrt(topup*deficit)),
# so 0 is the raw lerp and 1 restores the neighbours' spread exactly.
#
# HONEST CAVEAT, and it is not small: Var(x_hi - x_lo) also contains the real
# SIGNAL change between the two neighbours. On fast content the lerp is
# legitimately smoother than a real token because the content moved, and a full
# top-up then pays for real motion with white noise. Give sigma_s and the
# report prints the noise-only bound the flow parameterisation predicts -
# a handed-off latent is x/(1-sigma) with x = (1-sigma)x0 + sigma*eps, so an
# independent unit-white residual alone would explain
#     deficit_noise = 2 w (1-w) (sigma/(1-sigma))^2
# (H3's video scale_factor is 1.0, so process_latent_out does not rescale this
# [SRC comfy/latent_formats.py MiniMaxH3Video]). Measured deficit far above
# that bound means the excess is content, not noise.

    DESCRIPTION = (
        "EXPERIMENTAL PoC, off-distribution. The temporal insert done in the "
        "MIDDLE of a denoise instead of between two passes. Run the coarse "
        "grid down to a handoff sigma_s only (SplitSigmas' high half), hand "
        "the STILL-NOISY latent to this node, and sample the dilated grid "
        "from sigma_s to 0 (the low half) - the model then decides the "
        "motion with the in-betweens already in the sequence, and the coarse "
        "pass is partial.\n\n"
        "The grid arithmetic is H3 Temporal Insert's, shared code, so the two "
        "routes can never disagree about which token-times exist. What is "
        "different is the INIT: lerping two NOISY neighbours is variance-"
        "deficient, and noise_topup adds fresh gaussian noise sized from the "
        "MEASURED neighbour residual (per token, per channel) so the inserted "
        "tokens carry the same spread their neighbours do. 0 = raw lerp, "
        "1 = full top-up. The measured correlation and the deficit are "
        "printed in the report; wire sigma_s to also print the noise-only "
        "bound the flow parameterisation predicts, which is how you see how "
        "much of the deficit was real motion rather than noise.\n\n"
        "NO NOISE MASK, deliberately. A repaint mask re-noises its frozen "
        "content from a CLEAN latent every step (comfy/samplers.py "
        "KSamplerX0Inpaint), and this latent is not clean - it is already at "
        "sigma_s. Everything continues denoising together, which is the whole "
        "point. Any noise_mask on the incoming latent is dropped.\n\n"
        "WIRING: pass A SamplerCustomAdvanced ends on sigma_s and its "
        "'output' is the noisy latent (already divided by 1-sigma_s by "
        "inverse_noise_scaling); pass B MUST take DisableNoise, whose zero "
        "noise makes noise_scaling multiply by 1-sigma_s again and hand the "
        "sampler back exactly the state pass A left. RandomNoise on pass B "
        "would add a second full noise draw on top and destroy the handoff.\n\n"
        "AUDIO IS PASSED THROUGH UNCHANGED - it stays on the BASE clip's "
        "clock while the video moves onto the dilated one, so pass B sees an "
        "audio stream that covers only part of the video's span. Take the "
        "delivered audio from elsewhere. A plain video latent stays plain: "
        "unlike H3 Temporal Insert this node will NOT fabricate a zero audio "
