"""ComfyUI-MAINodes — MatlowAI's MiniMax-H3 node collection.

Two families in one pack:
- Contact-Sheet diffusion (five coordinated views from one reference) —
  V3-API nodes, unchanged from ComfyUI-H3-ContactSheet.
- Motion Lab (v2v time-smear de-roping pipeline: jerk oracle, time smear,
  inject schedule, exact recovery, oracle heatmap) — V1 nodes, defaults
  set to measured-best values.

Registration note: ComfyUI's loader treats NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS and
comfy_entrypoint as either-or (nodes.py: `elif hasattr(module,
"comfy_entrypoint")`), and its V3 path registers node classes into the
same mappings dict keyed by schema.node_id — so we merge the V3 classes
in here ourselves instead of exporting an entrypoint.

The original ComfyUI-H3-ContactSheet repo remains for existing installs;
this is the consolidated home going forward.

# executor; same rule.
