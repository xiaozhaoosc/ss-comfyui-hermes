"""The H3 AdaLN LoRA Fix node.

Drop it on the MODEL wire anywhere after the LoRA loaders -- rgthree's Power Lora
Loader, ComfyUI's own, any stack. It works on the patches those loaders already
attached, so it needs no knowledge of which LoRAs were chosen and nothing upstream
has to change.

    A pruned checkpoint stores its AdaLN projections over an 8-wide curve basis
    instead of the dense 2688-wide time embedding, so a LoRA trained on the full
    base cannot be applied to them: ComfyUI logs one ``ERROR lora ...`` line per key
    and drops all 51. This node rebases those weights so they apply properly, which
    silences the log and restores the timestep-modulation weights.

    Measured on real H3 turbo LoRAs that restored contribution is only ~0.02 % of
    the modulation signal, so the clean log is the real benefit -- do not expect a
    visible quality change. See ADALN.md for the numbers.
