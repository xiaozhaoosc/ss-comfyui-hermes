"""MMH3 Ultimate Upscale - one node for the full latent re-enhancement loop.

Pipeline (auto, no graph wiring):
    input AV latent
      -> temporal split (outer loop)
      ->   latent upscale  (H3 3D upscaler, per chunk, video only)
      ->   spatial split   (inner loop)
      ->   per-tile sampling with preview
      ->   spatial stitch
      -> temporal stitch
      -> output AV latent

Helpers (frame/token mapping, re-anchoring, spatial tiling, seam blending,
stitching) are self-contained copies of the logic used by the
Comfyui-MiniMax-H3-LatentSplit project so this plugin has no dependency on it.

Frame/token mapping mirrors comfy.ldm.minimax.model:
  * video latent token k covers FRAME_PER_TOKEN[k % 5] = (1, 4, 4, 4, 4) pixel
    frames (periodic grid, 17 frames per 5 tokens)
  * audio latent frames run at FRAME_RESCALE = 5/3 per pixel frame (40 vs 24 Hz)

The H3 3D upscaler inference code (model classes, loading, normalization stats)
is copied from the Comfyui_Minimax_h3_latent_Upscaler plugin so it works with
the minimax_h3_latent_upscaler_3d checkpoints directly.

    WHY THIS EXISTS - THE SEAM.

    Every tile used to call noise.generate_noise(its own latent), which is
    comfy.sample.prepare_noise(shape, seed). The seed is the same for all of
    them, but torch.randn fills a tensor ROW-MAJOR from the generator's
    stream, so the value that lands at a given spatial position depends on the
    tensor's WIDTH. Two tiles that overlap have different widths and different
    offsets, so for one picture position inside the shared band, tile A reads
    stream index y*W_A + x while tile B reads y*W_B + (x - offset). Those are
    unrelated numbers.

    The consequence is not subtle: the two tiles denoise the SAME region from
    DIFFERENT noise, converge on two different pictures, and the stitcher then
    cross-fades between them. That is a seam by construction. Overlap width,
    fade length and blend curve all act downstream of it, which is why tuning
    them can soften the edge but never remove it.

    The fix is to make the noise a property of the CHUNK rather than of the
    tile: draw one field at the chunk's full size, then hand each tile the
    slice that sits under it. Both tiles then see identical noise where they
    overlap and, given the same conditioning and the same schedule, converge on
    very nearly the same picture there - so the blend is joining two views of
    one image rather than two different images.

    This is the same reason a tiled VAE decode has no seams: it is
    deterministic, so neighbouring tiles cannot disagree.

    WHY THIS EXISTS.

    A tiled VAE decode has no seams, and it is worth being precise about why:
    its per-tile function is a single deterministic pass, so two tiles that
    overlap compute the SAME pixels twice and the feathered accumulator simply
    reconstructs them. The mask is bookkeeping, not repair.

    spatial_process() borrows that accumulator but hands it a whole denoising
    TRAJECTORY per tile. A trajectory is not deterministic across tiles: the
    same latent patch sits at the edge of one tile and in the middle of
    another, so the transformer sees different neighbours and returns different
    content. The accumulator is then averaging two different pictures, and a
    blend between two different pictures is a seam. That is why widening the
    overlap, lengthening the fade or changing the curve only ever softened it.

    So this keeps comfy's accumulator exactly and changes what is accumulated:
    ONE forward per tile per step, merged into ONE latent, stepped once. A
    single forward is near enough deterministic given the same input, which is
    the property the decode has and a trajectory does not. Tiles are
    re-synchronised after every step, so they never get the chance to diverge.

    Cost is the same as before - tiles x steps forwards, one tile of
    activations at a time. What changes is that the tiles are solving one
    problem together rather than N problems separately.
