"""Wire the block-sparse kernel into MiniMax-H3 attention, at inference time.

The hook is ``transformer_options["optimized_attention_override"]``, read by
``wrap_attn`` in ``comfy/ldm/modules/attention.py``. H3 reaches it from its one
attention call site, ``comfy/ldm/minimax/model.py:172``.

The legacy ``set_model_attn1_patch`` hook does *not* work here: it is the
SD-UNet cross-attention path, and H3 is a DiT that never consults it. A patch
installed that way reports success and silently does nothing -- which is the
failure this whole module exists to avoid, hence the invocation counter below.

Layout at the call site: q/k/v arrive ``[1, 56, S, 128]`` bf16 with
``skip_reshape=True``, ``mask=None``, RoPE already applied. H3 does not pass
``skip_output_reshape``, so we owe it ``[1, S, 7168]`` back.

    ``attention_pytorch``) that every dense fall-through uses instead of
    ``func``. Without it, ``func`` is whatever ``optimized_attention``
    currently resolves to -- which can be ck-attention under
    ``--use-ck-attention`` or an attention-override node, and running the
    dense steps on ck measurably loses quality versus pytorch. Pinning
    ``dense_fn`` makes the dense path deterministic regardless of what else
    is set globally; the sparse path is unaffected either way, since it
    never calls ``func`` at all.

    ``stabilize_motion`` carries each layer's near-cutoff target-video choices
    into ``get_block_map`` as a tie-breaker (see block_map.py). Text and audio
    query routing remains step-local. ``state["call_idx"]``
    is the layer identity this relies on -- it counts calls within the
    current step, reset to 0 by the wrapper at the top of every step, and it
    works because the model graph is static: the Nth attention call happens
    in the same layer every step.

    ``engine="comfy_kitchen"`` swaps this file's own Triton kernel for
    comfy_kitchen's real compiled sol_attn kernel -- see ``_ck_sol_attn``'s
    docstring for exactly what that engine cannot express relative to
    ``engine="triton"`` (the default, and everything documented above).

    """Return a clone of ``model`` whose H3 self-attention runs block-sparse.

    Weights are untouched; this only installs an attention override and a
    per-step wrapper on the clone.

    ``dense_backend`` pins every dense fall-through (short sequences,
    ``dense_last_steps``, and explicit ``dense_steps``) to a specific
    attention kernel -- default "comfy_kitchen" (Comfy Kitchen int8), since it's fast
    enough on the handful of dense steps this node runs to be worth its
    precision tradeoff there. "pytorch" pins the plain reference kernel
    instead if you want zero quantization anywhere in the dense path, at
    real cost to dense-step speed. "auto" restores the old behaviour of
    calling whatever the environment already resolved (e.g.
    ``--use-ck-attention`` or an attention-override node) -- note this can
    silently differ run to run if that global setting changes.

    ``disable_fp16_accum`` forces off the fp16/bf16 reduced-precision matmul
    reduction (what ``--fast fp16_accumulation`` enables) for the duration of
    this model's sampling run, regardless of the global launch flag --
    measured to cost quality on H3 for no throughput gain.

    ``stabilize_motion`` biases block selection toward what each layer picked
    last step (see block_map.py's ``prev_lut``), to cut down on a block
    flipping between two near-tied candidates step to step for no reason tied
    to actual content -- visible on fast motion as a faint double-exposure.
    Off by default: it's a real fix for that specific symptom, not a general
    quality dial, and adds a small amount of state to carry between steps.

    ``protect_audio`` is an all-or-nothing safety switch for language,
    reference-audio, and target-audio ranges.

    ``reference_protection`` controls a separate visual-reference quota:
    ``Off`` leaves references to global top-k, ``Heavy Enforcement``
    guarantees all of them (a reinforcement of those blocks, not a quality
    tuned protection, and most likely unusable with max ref size mode), and
    ``Light`` guarantees the best 15% of every reference range without
    displacing ordinary video choices.

    ``tail_correction`` adds one pooled term per query block standing in for
    every key block ``topk`` left out, instead of plain top-k's hard zero for
    anything unselected -- see block_map.py's ``get_block_map`` docstring.
    Off by default: it's new, it costs one extra mean-pool of V plus a small
    reduction per call, and its quality effect on H3 specifically hasn't been
    validated the way ``sparsity_ratio``'s defaults have.

    ``use_int8_qk`` quantizes Q and K to int8 (per-token, dynamic scale)
    before the QK dot product on the selected topk blocks only -- PV stays
    native dtype, matching SageAttention's ``qk_int8_pv_fp16`` split rather
    than full int8 attention. UNTESTED ON HARDWARE as of this addition: the
    quantize/dequantize math was checked against exact fp32 QK scores in a
    standalone numpy harness (~1% mean relative error on synthetic data,
    numerically stable feeding the softmax), but the actual Triton kernel
    path -- launch config, register pressure, real speed and quality on H3 --
    has not been run on a GPU. Off by default for that reason alone, not
    because the math is suspect. Ignored entirely when ``engine="comfy_kitchen"``,
    which quantizes internally regardless of this flag.

    ``use_int8_pv`` independently quantizes P and V to int8 for the second
    matmul -- see ``block_sparse_attention``'s docstring for why V needs
    per-channel quantization here rather than the per-token scheme
    ``use_int8_qk`` uses, and why P itself can't be precomputed the way K/V
    can. Same UNTESTED-ON-HARDWARE caveat as ``use_int8_qk``, checked the
    same way (numpy harness against exact fp32 P@V, combined with
    ``use_int8_qk`` end-to-end against dense ground truth). Also ignored
    under ``engine="comfy_kitchen"``.

    ``engine`` picks which attention implementation runs the sparse path:
    ``"triton"`` (default) is this package's own kernel, everything else in
    this docstring applies to it. ``"comfy_kitchen"`` instead calls
    ``comfy_kitchen``'s real compiled sol_attn kernel (Comfy-Org/ComfyUI PR
    #16072, comfy-kitchen>=0.2.32) -- genuine CUDA int8 compute and a
    pooled tail gated by ``tail_correction`` same as the Triton path.
    Prefix protection, every span in ``protect_ranges``, and reference
    protection are all supported here too, by reordering K/V so the whole
    protected set is contiguous and pointing sol_attn's single ``sink_blocks``
    range at it -- exact for everything except the Light reference tier
    specifically, which becomes a query-averaged approximation instead of
    the Triton engine's true per-query-block selection; see
    ``_ck_sol_attn``'s docstring for the reasoning. ``stabilize_motion`` has
    no equivalent regardless (sol_attn's routing is stateless per call) and
    is silently ignored with a one-time warning. Both engines fall back to
    dense the same as any other kernel failure if their kernel is
    unavailable or throws. A saved workflow with the removed ``"hybrid"``
    value is treated as ``"triton"``.
